              <h3>Brucellosis <br> 布病</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            Epidemiology of Brucellosis:<br>Brucellosis, also known as Malta fever, Mediterranean fever, or undulant fever, is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacteria of the genus Brucella. It primarily affects animals, particularly livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. However, humans can also contract the disease through contact with infected animals or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products.<br>Global Prevalence:
Brucellosis is considered a major public health concern in many parts of the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that around half a million cases of human brucellosis occur annually worldwide. However, due to underreporting and limited surveillance systems, the actual number of cases is likely much higher.<br>Transmission Routes:
The main modes of transmission of Brucellosis to humans include direct contact with infected animals, such as handling fetal tissues, placenta, or other birth products, or ingestion of contaminated animal products like unpasteurized milk or cheese. Inhalation of infectious aerosols may also contribute to the spread of the disease, particularly in occupational settings such as slaughterhouses or laboratories.<br>Affected Populations:
Brucellosis can affect individuals of all ages and genders. Certain occupations, such as farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and laboratory personnel, are at a higher risk of contracting the disease due to their frequent exposure to infected animals or samples. Moreover, people living in rural or agricultural areas with close contact with animals are also vulnerable to Brucellosis.<br>Key Statistics:
The exact number of Brucellosis cases varies globally. However, it is more commonly reported in regions where livestock farming is prevalent, such as the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America, and certain parts of Asia. In these regions, the reported annual incidence can range from 10 to 200 cases per 100,000 population.<br>Historical Context and Discovery:
Brucellosis was first discovered and described by Sir David Bruce, a British physician, in Malta in 1886. He identified a cluster of cases among British soldiers and attributed it to the consumption of contaminated goat milk. Since then, other species of Brucella have been identified, including B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, each associated with different animal hosts and transmission patterns.<br>Major Risk Factors:
Several risk factors contribute to the transmission of Brucellosis. These include direct contact with animals or their bodily fluids, consumption of raw or unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals, occupational exposure in high-risk industries, and living in areas with a high prevalence of the disease.<br>Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The regional impact of Brucellosis varies due to differences in livestock farming practices, diagnostic capabilities, awareness, and control measures. For instance, in areas where livestock production is a crucial component of the economy, such as certain countries in the Middle East and Africa, the disease burden is often higher. Moreover, marginalized populations, such as refugees or inhabitants of resource-limited communities, may experience increased vulnerability due to limited healthcare facilities and poor livestock management practices.<br>Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:
Brucellosis prevalence rates differ among populations and regions. For example, in the Mediterranean basin and Middle Eastern countries, B. melitensis is the most common species causing human infection, primarily transmitted through sheep and goats. On the other hand, B. abortus is more prevalent in regions where cattle farming is prominent, like parts of South and Central America.<br>In conclusion, Brucellosis is a significant global health concern, primarily affecting individuals with occupational exposure to animals or consumption of contaminated animal products. Its impact varies across regions, with higher prevalence rates found in areas with intensive livestock farming. Effective control strategies, including improved animal health management, vaccination programs, and education regarding food safety and hygienic practices, are crucial to reducing the burden of Brucellosis worldwide.

            The data presented in this paper indicates a well-defined seasonal pattern for Brucellosis cases in mainland China, with an increase in cases from winter to spring and a peak in the summer months of June, July, and August. Conversely, cases tend to decrease during the fall and winter months. Notably, this peak and trough pattern is consistent over time, with a consistently high number of cases reported during the summer months and a consistently low number during the winter months, specifically December and January. Examining the overall trend, the number of cases has exhibited a fluctuating pattern, with periods of increase followed by periods of decline. Between 2010 and 2015, cases demonstrably increased, peaking in 2015, before gradually declining until 2020, and experiencing a slight uptick in 2021 and 2022. However, the analysis reveals no definitive upward or downward trend in the data. These findings suggest that environmental, agricultural, and behavioral factors may play a critical role in inducing the observed seasonal pattern, likely through increased outdoor activities, animal contact, and consumption of contaminated food products. Given the regularity of the seasonal pattern, health authorities should focus on implementing targeted preventive measures, including promoting awareness, improving hygiene practices, and enhancing surveillance and control efforts during the high transmission season.

            <br>
            Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, and it has been a longstanding public health concern worldwide, particularly in regions with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. The epidemiology of cholera is characterized by periodic outbreaks and endemicity in specific regions.<br>Historically, cholera has been documented as a disease dating back to ancient times. However, it was not until the 19th century that the connection between contaminated water and cholera transmission was discovered. In 1854, John Snow, an English physician, identified a specific well as the source of a cholera outbreak in London, providing strong evidence for the waterborne transmission of the disease.<br>Currently, cholera is endemic in many parts of the world, with periodic outbreaks occurring. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 million cholera cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths occur globally each year. However, these numbers are likely underestimated due to underreporting and limited surveillance in some countries.<br>The primary mode of transmission for cholera is through the ingestion of water or food contaminated with the feces of an infected individual. The bacterium Vibrio cholerae is commonly found in water sources contaminated with human feces, and it can survive in aquatic environments. Consuming uncooked or undercooked seafood from contaminated waters can also transmit the disease. Person-to-person transmission is rare but can occur in densely populated areas with poor sanitation.<br>Cholera affects individuals of all ages and genders, but certain populations are more vulnerable. This includes individuals living in poverty with limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Refugee camps, slums, and overcrowded areas with poor hygiene practices are particularly at high risk. Additionally, individuals with compromised immune systems, such as malnourished individuals or those with other underlying medical conditions, may be more susceptible to severe cholera infections.<br>Several risk factors contribute to the transmission of cholera. Poor sanitation, lack of clean water, and inadequate sanitation facilities are significant risk factors. Improper handwashing and hygiene practices also contribute to disease transmission. Climate-related factors, such as heavy rainfall and flooding, can exacerbate the spread of cholera by contaminating water sources. Furthermore, population displacement, poor healthcare infrastructure, and limited access to quality healthcare services can hinder prevention and control measures.<br>Cholera has a greater impact on regions with limited resources and infrastructure to control the disease. Sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia (including Bangladesh and India), and Haiti in the Americas have experienced significant cholera outbreaks in recent years. Additionally, during humanitarian crises, such as natural disasters or armed conflicts, the risk of cholera outbreaks increases due to disrupted water and sanitation systems.<br>The prevalence rates of cholera can vary across regions and populations. In high-risk areas, cholera can become endemic, with frequent outbreaks and ongoing transmission. For example, in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is endemic and occurs seasonally. These regions also face higher rates of severe cholera infections and associated mortality.<br>Demographically, cholera affects all age groups, but children under five years old are particularly vulnerable. This vulnerability is partly due to their weaker immune systems and increased susceptibility to complications related to dehydration. During outbreaks, cholera disproportionately affects marginalized and vulnerable populations, including those living in poverty and in areas with limited access to healthcare.<br>In conclusion, cholera remains a significant public health concern globally, with periodic outbreaks and endemicity in specific regions. Poor sanitation, inadequate access to clean water, and limited healthcare infrastructure are major risk factors associated with cholera transmission. The impact of cholera varies across different regions and populations, with higher prevalence rates and severe outcomes observed in areas with limited resources and infrastructure to control the disease. Efforts to improve sanitation, access to clean water, and promote hygiene practices are crucial for preventing and controlling cholera.

            Seasonal Patterns:<br>Based on the monthly data for cholera cases in mainland China before August 2023, it is evident that there is a distinct seasonal pattern in the occurrence of cases. Cholera cases are more prevalent during the summer months and decrease during the winter months. This aligns with the known transmission patterns of cholera, as the bacteria responsible for the disease thrive in warm water and contaminated food, which are typically more abundant during the summer.<br>Peak and Trough Periods:<br>The peak period for cholera cases in mainland China is observed during the summer months, particularly in July and August. During these months, there is a notable surge in the number of cases, with the highest recorded value in August 2010, when 63 cases were reported. Conversely, the trough period for cholera cases is observed during the winter months, from December to February, in which consistently very few or even zero cases are reported.<br>Overall Trends:<br>Examining the overall trend of cholera cases in mainland China before August 2023, there is a general fluctuation in the number of cases from year to year. The number of cases ranges from 0 to 18 per month, with sporadic spikes in certain months. However, there is no clear upward or downward trend observed over the years. It is important to note that the data for 2023 is incomplete, as it only includes data up to August.<br>The seasonal patterns of cholera cases in mainland China underscore the significance of understanding the environmental factors that contribute to the disease's transmission. In this case, the increase in cases during the summer months can be attributed to factors such as warmer temperatures and elevated water and food contamination. This information can be invaluable for public health authorities when planning and implementing targeted interventions to prevent and control cholera outbreaks in mainland China.<br>However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the overall trend of cholera cases does not exhibit a consistent pattern of increase or decrease over time. This suggests the possibility of other influencing factors, including variations in reporting or surveillance systems, changes in population vulnerability, or the effectiveness of cholera prevention and control measures. Further analysis and investigation are necessary to identify and comprehend these factors, ultimately leading to the development of more effective strategies for cholera prevention and control in mainland China.

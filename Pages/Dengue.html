            <br>
            Dengue, caused by the dengue virus and transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti, is a highly significant mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide. It is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, primarily in urban and semi-urban areas.<br>Dengue has been a documented disease for centuries, with evidence suggesting its existence as far back as the 18th century. The first recorded epidemics occurred in the 1770s and 1780s in Asia, Africa, and North America. The term "dengue" originates from the Swahili phrase "Ka-dinga pepo," which means "cramp-like seizure caused by the evil spirit." In 1906, the role of Aedes mosquitoes in transmitting dengue was identified, and subsequent studies confirmed the presence of different serotypes of the dengue virus.<br>Dengue is endemic in over 100 countries, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, the Americas, Africa, and the Pacific. Annually, an estimated 390 million dengue infections occur, with approximately 96 million displaying clinical symptoms. The number of reported cases has surged in recent decades, posing a global health concern.<br>The primary mode of dengue transmission is through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. These mosquitoes thrive in urban and semi-urban areas, where they breed in standing water. Additionally, dengue can be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ transplants, or from mother to fetus during pregnancy.<br>Dengue affects people of all ages and genders, with individuals living in or traveling to dengue-endemic regions being at risk. However, severe forms of the disease are more likely to develop in children, infants, and pregnant women. Factors such as immune status and genetic predisposition can also influence susceptibility to severe dengue.<br>Several risk factors contribute to dengue transmission, including rapid urbanization, unplanned urban development, and inadequate sanitation, which promote the proliferation of Aedes mosquitoes. Climate change, resulting in warmer temperatures and increased rainfall, also facilitates mosquito breeding and subsequently higher transmission rates. International travel to dengue-endemic regions can introduce the virus to new areas, potentially triggering outbreaks. Challenges in vector control, such as insecticide resistance and ineffective measures, hinder efforts to control mosquito populations and prevent dengue transmission.<br>Dengue's impact varies across different regions, with the highest burden observed in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines report significant numbers of cases. Latin America and the Caribbean also experience high incidence rates. While dengue primarily affects people in urban and peri-urban areas with poor sanitation and limited access to reliable healthcare, outbreaks can occur in developed regions with efficient mosquito control due to the introduction of new virus serotypes.<br>Prevalence rates and affected demographics can vary within regions and countries, influenced by factors such as population density, climate, healthcare infrastructure, and socio-economic conditions.<br>In conclusion, dengue is a major global health concern with significant epidemiological implications. Its transmission by infected Aedes mosquitoes, combined with urbanization, climate change, and inadequate vector control, contribute to its widespread prevalence. Dengue affects people of all ages, with severe consequences for children, infants, and pregnant women. Understanding dengue's epidemiology is crucial for developing effective prevention and control strategies to mitigate its impact.

            Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, there is a clear seasonal pattern in the number of dengue cases in mainland China. The highest number of cases occurs during the summer months (June to August) and the lowest number occurs during the winter months (December to February). This pattern remains consistent over multiple years.<br>Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for dengue cases in mainland China is observed during July and August, with significantly higher case numbers compared to other months. Conversely, the trough period occurs from December to February, when the number of cases reaches its lowest point.<br>Overall Trends: 
Overall, there is an upward trend in the number of dengue cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. Although there are fluctuations in case numbers throughout the years, some experiencing higher peaks than others, the general trend is increasing. This indicates a growing burden of dengue in the country.<br>Discussion: 
The seasonal pattern of dengue cases in mainland China aligns with the known transmission dynamics of the disease. Aedes mosquitoes, the primary vectors of dengue, are more active during the warmer months, explaining the higher number of cases during summer. The reduced mosquito activity and lower transmission rates during winter contribute to the lower number of cases.<br>The peak period of dengue cases in July and August is likely influenced by factors such as higher temperatures, increased rainfall, and higher mosquito populations. These conditions provide a favorable environment for mosquito breeding and dengue transmission.<br>The overall increasing trend in dengue cases suggests that the disease is becoming a growing public health concern in mainland China. This can be attributed to urbanization, climate change, and increased travel and trade, which promote the spread of dengue and the expansion of mosquito habitats.<br>It is crucial for public health authorities to continuously monitor and implement effective control measures to prevent and control dengue transmission in mainland China. These measures include mosquito control strategies, public awareness campaigns, and strengthening surveillance and response systems to promptly detect and respond to outbreaks.

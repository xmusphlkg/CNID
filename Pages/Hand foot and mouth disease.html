            <br>
            Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a highly contagious viral illness that primarily affects infants and young children. It is caused by several different types of enteroviruses, most commonly, Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16). This condition is characterized by fever, sore throat, and blister-like lesions on the hands, feet, and mouth.<br>HFMD was first recognized in New Zealand in 1957. However, it likely existed prior to that but was not formally identified. Initially, it was believed to be solely caused by Coxsackievirus A16. However, with the development of advanced laboratory techniques and improved diagnostic methods, other enteroviruses like EV71 were also identified as causative agents of HFMD.<br>HFMD is prevalent globally and is endemic in many parts of the world. However, it is more commonly reported in the Asia-Pacific region, including countries such as China, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Outbreaks are more prevalent during the warmer months and tend to occur in cyclical patterns every few years. While the disease is also found in other regions, such as Europe, North America, and Africa, its incidence is lower.<br>Transmission of HFMD usually occurs through direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, and feces of infected individuals. The virus can also spread through respiratory droplets, such as through coughing or sneezing. It can survive on surfaces outside the body for several hours, increasing the risk of transmission via contaminated objects or surfaces.<br>Although HFMD affects people of all ages, children under the age of five are most susceptible due to their developing immune systems and lack of previous exposure. In densely populated areas such as daycares, schools, and boarding facilities, there is an increased risk of transmission. Additionally, the virus can be transmitted from mother to baby during childbirth.<br>The major risk factors associated with HFMD transmission include poor personal hygiene practices, close contact with infected individuals, and crowded living conditions. Lack of proper handwashing, sharing of contaminated objects, and failure to cover the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing contribute to the spread of the virus.<br>The impact of HFMD varies across different regions and populations. In the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in countries like China and Taiwan, large-scale outbreaks occur periodically, affecting thousands of children. The disease can lead to severe complications in some cases, including viral meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and acute flaccid paralysis.<br>Prevalence rates and affected demographics can differ within regions and even within countries. For example, in China, HFMD cases are more prevalent in rural areas compared to urban regions. This disparity may be due to differences in healthcare access, sanitation, and population density. Certain demographics, such as young children in crowded environments, are at a higher risk of infection and severe complications.<br>In conclusion, HFMD is a globally prevalent viral illness primarily affecting children. The disease is transmitted through direct contact with infected fluids and feces, as well as respiratory droplets. Risk factors include poor personal hygiene, crowded living conditions, and close contact with infected individuals. HFMD has a significant impact on different regions and populations, with variations in prevalence rates and affected demographics. Efforts to prevent and control the disease focus on maintaining good hygiene practices, early detection, and appropriate medical care.

            Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, a distinct seasonal pattern for Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in mainland China is apparent. The number of cases shows a consistent increase during the spring and summer months, reaching its highest point between May and July. This is followed by a gradual decrease during the fall and winter months, with the lowest activity occurring between December and February.<br>Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for HFMD cases in mainland China commonly falls between May and July, with the highest number of cases being reported during this time. Conversely, the trough period, characterized by the least number of cases, typically spans from December to February.<br>Overall Trends: 
From 2010 to 2023, mainland China has experienced an overall upward trend in the incidence of HFMD cases. While the number of cases fluctuates from year to year, some years exhibiting higher peaks than others, an overall increase is evident over time.<br>Discussion: 
The observed seasonal pattern of HFMD in mainland China aligns with the recognized characteristics of the disease. HFMD is known to be more prevalent during warmer months due to the thriving conditions for causative viruses, such as enterovirus, in warm and humid environments. The peak period of HFMD cases in May to July coincides with the summer season, which is characterized by elevated temperatures.<br>The overall rise in HFMD cases over the years can be attributed to several factors, including improved surveillance and reporting systems, increased awareness and diagnosis of the disease, population growth, and changes in environmental and socioeconomic factors. It is important to note that the provided data only includes cases and deaths documented before September 2023, thus further analysis is necessary to evaluate the influence of interventions and public health measures on disease trends.<br>Moreover, it is noteworthy that negative values are present in some months, particularly in the early years. These negative values may indicate data reporting issues or inconsistencies and should be investigated further to ensure accuracy.<br>In conclusion, the data suggests a distinct seasonal pattern with peak HFMD activity observed in the spring and summer months in mainland China. The overall trend reveals a progressive increase in HFMD cases, emphasizing the importance of ongoing surveillance and preventive measures to control disease transmission.

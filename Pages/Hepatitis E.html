              <h3>Hepatitis E <br> 戊肝</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            Hepatitis E is an acute viral infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) that primarily affects the liver. It is characterized by symptoms such as jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. The prevalence of hepatitis E differs globally across regions and populations.<br>Historical Context and Discovery:
Hepatitis E was initially identified in 1980 during an outbreak in Kashmir, India, where roughly 50,000 cases were reported. However, the formal classification of the virus did not occur until 1990. The understanding of this disease advanced through the discovery of the HEV genome and the development of diagnostic tests.<br>Prevalence:
Hepatitis E is endemic in many developing countries, particularly in parts of Asia, Africa, and Central America. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 20 million HEV infections occur annually worldwide, resulting in roughly 44,000 deaths. However, these estimates may be conservative as many cases go unreported or are misdiagnosed due to the similarity of symptoms with other types of hepatitis.<br>Transmission Routes:
Hepatitis E can spread through fecal-oral routes, mainly via contaminated water and food. Transmission can also occur through the transfusion of infected blood products, organ transplantation from infected donors, and vertical transmission from mother to fetus. In regions where sanitation is poor and access to clean water is limited, the risk of transmission is higher.<br>Affected Populations:
Hepatitis E can affect individuals of all age groups, but pregnant women and people with pre-existing liver disease are at an increased risk of severe illness or complications. Pregnant women infected with HEV have a significantly higher mortality rate, especially during the third trimester.<br>Risk Factors:
Several major risk factors are associated with Hepatitis E transmission, including:
1. Unsafe water sources and inadequate sanitation infrastructure.
2. Consumption of contaminated water or food, particularly raw or undercooked meat, shellfish, and vegetables.
3. Crowded living conditions, such as refugee camps or slums, where maintaining proper hygiene practices can be challenging.
4. Traveling to areas with a high incidence of Hepatitis E.
5. Occupational exposure to animals, such as swine, that may carry the virus.<br>Impact on Regions and Populations:
The prevalence of Hepatitis E varies across regions worldwide. In resource-limited countries, particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of the disease is higher due to inadequate sanitation facilities and limited access to clean water. Outbreaks are frequently reported in these regions, especially during natural disasters, conflict situations, or mass gatherings.<br>In developed countries, Hepatitis E is usually sporadic and is often associated with travel to endemic regions or consumption of contaminated imported food products. However, autochthonous transmission (acquired within the resident population) has also been occasionally reported.<br>Overall, Hepatitis E is more common in low-to-middle-income countries with poor sanitation conditions and limited healthcare resources. Nevertheless, advancements in sanitation infrastructure and increased access to clean water have helped reduce the burden of the disease in certain regions.<br>In conclusion, Hepatitis E is a global health concern, particularly in regions with inadequate sanitation and contaminated water sources. It can affect individuals of all ages, but pregnant women and people with pre-existing liver disease are at a higher risk. Efforts to improve sanitation, access to clean water, and raise awareness about safe food and water practices are essential for reducing the transmission and impact of Hepatitis E.

            Seasonal Patterns: 
The data provided reveals a notable seasonal pattern in Hepatitis E cases across mainland China. Reports indicate an increase in cases during the spring and summer months (March to August), followed by a decrease during the fall and winter months (September to February).<br>Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Hepatitis E cases in mainland China typically occurs in March and April, with cases reaching their maximum levels. Following this peak, the number of cases decreases to reach its lowest point during the winter months, specifically in December and January. This pattern of peaks and troughs remains consistent throughout the years covered by the data.<br>Overall Trends: 
An examination of the overall trend shows a general rise in Hepatitis E cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. However, fluctuations occur within this overall trend, with some years experiencing a higher or lower number of cases compared to the previous year.<br>Discussion: 
The observed seasonal pattern for Hepatitis E cases in mainland China, with peak periods during the spring and summer months, is consistent with the known features of the virus. Hepatitis E is mainly transmitted through the consumption of contaminated water or food, with warmer weather facilitating the growth and survival of the virus in the environment.<br>Various factors could influence fluctuations in the number of cases from year to year, including surveillance and reporting practices, population susceptibility, and variations in environmental conditions. Hence, public health authorities must closely track these trends and implement appropriate preventive measures, such as improving water and food safety, to alleviate the burden of Hepatitis E in mainland China.

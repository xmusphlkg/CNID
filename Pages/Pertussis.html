            </div>
            <br>
            Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. This disease has been present throughout history, with documented outbreaks dating back to the 16th century. However, it was only in 1906 that Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou discovered the specific bacterium responsible for pertussis.<br>Transmission of pertussis primarily occurs through respiratory droplets when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Others in close proximity can inhale the bacteria, leading to infection. Pertussis is highly infectious, with an estimated reproduction number (R0) of 12-17, meaning each infected individual can transmit the disease to 12-17 susceptible individuals.<br>Although pertussis can affect individuals of all ages, it is most severe in infants under one year old. Infants are especially vulnerable because they have not completed the full series of vaccinations. Pertussis can cause severe coughing fits, difficulty breathing, and in some cases, life-threatening complications. Older children and adults can also contract pertussis, but their symptoms are generally milder and may resemble a prolonged cough.<br>Globally, pertussis remains a significant public health concern. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 24.1 million cases of pertussis occurred worldwide in 2019, resulting in approximately 160,700 deaths. However, these figures may be underestimated due to underreporting and limited resources for accurate diagnosis in many regions.<br>The burden of pertussis varies among different regions and populations. In high-income countries with robust immunization programs, the incidence of pertussis has significantly decreased. However, occasional outbreaks still occur, primarily affecting unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals and those with waning immunity. In low- and middle-income countries, pertussis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in infants.<br>There are several risk factors associated with pertussis transmission:<br>1. Lack of Vaccination: Individuals who are unvaccinated or have not completed the recommended immunization schedule are at a higher risk of contracting pertussis.<br>2. Waning Immunity: Over time, the protection provided by the pertussis vaccine diminishes, making previously vaccinated individuals susceptible to infection.<br>3. Close Contact: Being in close proximity to an infected person, particularly in crowded settings like households, schools, or childcare facilities, increases the likelihood of transmission.<br>4. Age: Infants, especially those under six months old, face the highest risk of severe disease and complications. Adolescents and adults can also transmit the infection to vulnerable populations.<br>5. Maternal Transmission: Mothers with pertussis can transmit the infection to their newborns. Vaccination during pregnancy (preferably between the 27th and 36th weeks) can offer some protection to the newborn.<br>The impact of pertussis varies across regions and populations. In high-income countries, where vaccination coverage is high, pertussis rates have significantly declined compared to the pre-vaccine era. However, occasional outbreaks occur due to waning immunity or vaccine hesitancy. In low- and middle-income countries, pertussis remains a major public health issue, contributing to high infant mortality rates. Limited access to healthcare, inadequate immunization coverage, and challenges in diagnosis and treatment all contribute to the persistence of pertussis in these regions.<br>In conclusion, pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It has a global prevalence, with millions of cases reported annually. Pertussis primarily affects infants, but individuals of all ages can be affected. Risk factors for pertussis transmission include lack of vaccination, waning immunity, close contact with infected individuals, and age. The impact of pertussis varies across regions, with higher-income countries experiencing lower prevalence rates compared to lower-income countries, where pertussis remains a substantial burden. Vaccination coverage and public health measures play a crucial role in reducing the transmission and impact of pertussis.

            Seasonal Patterns: 
Analysis of the data reveals a distinct seasonal pattern for Pertussis cases in mainland China. The incidence tends to be higher during the summer and fall months, specifically from June to October. Throughout this period, the number of cases gradually increases, reaching its peak in either August or September, before subsequently declining towards the end of the year. In contrast, the winter and spring months, spanning from November to May, generally exhibit lower case counts.<br>Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Pertussis cases in mainland China predominantly occurs in August and September. During these months, the number of cases reaches its highest point, with values occasionally surpassing 4000 in certain years. Conversely, the trough period usually takes place during the winter and spring months, from November to May, when the number of cases is at its lowest, often falling below 500.<br>Overall Trends: 
Overall, there is an upward trend in Pertussis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. The number of cases demonstrates a gradual increase throughout this period, with some year-to-year fluctuations. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant decrease in cases observed in 2020, which can likely be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures.<br>Discussion: 
The seasonal pattern of Pertussis cases in mainland China suggests a higher prevalence of the disease during the summer and fall months, aligning with the known transmission dynamics of Pertussis. The peak occurring in August and September may be influenced by factors such as heightened social interactions, travel, and gatherings during the summer vacation period. Additionally, the lower case counts observed during the winter and spring months may be attributed to reduced transmission and heightened awareness of respiratory hygiene practices during colder weather.<br>The overall increasing trend in Pertussis cases over the years underscores the necessity for ongoing surveillance and preventive measures. Vaccination against Pertussis serves as an effective strategy for disease control, thereby warranting efforts to ensure high vaccination coverage, particularly among infants and young children who are most susceptible to severe complications. Furthermore, raising awareness about Pertussis symptoms, early diagnosis, and appropriate treatment can contribute to alleviating the burden of the disease.<br>It is noteworthy that the data pertaining to deaths associated with Pertussis is relatively low, with most months reporting zero deaths. However, there are sporadic occurrences of deaths reported throughout the years, underscoring the significance of timely diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and supportive care for individuals affected by Pertussis.<br>In sum, this analysis provides valuable insights into the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends of Pertussis cases in mainland China. Continuous monitoring and implementation of preventive measures are pivotal in mitigating the impact of Pertussis and safeguarding public health.

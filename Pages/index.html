            The numbers of cases and cause-specific deaths refer to data recorded in National Notifiable Disease Reporting System in China, which includes both clinically-diagnosed cases and laboratory-confirmed cases. Only reported cases of the 31 provincial-level administrative divisions in Chinese mainland are included in the table, whereas data of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macau Special Administrative Region, and Taiwan, China are not included. Monthly statistics are calculated without annual verification which is usually conducted in February of the next year for de-duplication and verification of reported cases in annual statistics. Therefore, 12-month cases could not be added together directly to calculate the cumulative cases because the individual information might be verified via National Notifiable Disease Reporting System according to information verification or field investigations by local CDCs.

            Seasonal Patterns:<br>The data provided suggests a distinct seasonal pattern in the number of cases and deaths in mainland China. Cases and deaths tend to be higher during the winter months (December to February) and lower during the summer months (June to August). This pattern remains consistent across multiple years.<br>Peak and Trough Periods:<br>The highest numbers of cases and deaths occur during the winter months, particularly in December and January. These months consistently exhibit the highest figures. Conversely, the lowest numbers of cases and deaths are observed during the summer months, particularly in July and August.<br>Overall Trends:<br>There is an upward trend in the number of cases and deaths in mainland China leading up to September 2023. Generally, cases and deaths have increased from 2010 to 2020, with intermittent fluctuations. However, it is important to note that the data only covers until September 2023, thus the overall trend for the entire year remains unaccounted for.<br>Discussion:<br>The observed seasonal patterns in the data imply that certain factors may have an impact on the transmission and severity of the disease in mainland China. The larger number of cases and deaths during the winter months can be attributed to factors such as increased indoor gatherings, lower humidity, and lower temperatures, which can facilitate the spread of the disease.<br>The increasing trend in the number of cases and deaths indicates that the disease has been a persistent public health concern in mainland China. Epidemiologists and public health officials should monitor and analyze these trends closely to inform prevention and control measures.<br>It is worth noting that the provided data lacks specific information about the disease and the population size, limiting the ability to draw conclusive findings about the disease dynamics. Additionally, the sudden decline in cases and deaths in 2013, as well as the negative values reported for certain months, may be anomalies or reporting errors that warrant further investigation.<br>Overall, further analysis and investigation are required to fully comprehend the underlying factors influencing the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends in cases and deaths in mainland China.

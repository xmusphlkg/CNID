The data presented in this paper indicates a well-defined seasonal pattern for Brucellosis cases in Chinese mainland, with an increase in cases from winter to spring and a peak in the summer months of June, July, and August. Conversely, cases tend to decrease during the fall and winter months. Notably, this peak and trough pattern is consistent over time, with a consistently high number of cases reported during the summer months and a consistently low number during the winter months, specifically December and January. Examining the overall trend, the number of cases has exhibited a fluctuating pattern, with periods of increase followed by periods of decline. Between 2010 and 2015, cases demonstrably increased, peaking in 2015, before gradually declining until 2020, and experiencing a slight uptick in 2021 and 2022. However, the analysis reveals no definitive upward or downward trend in the data. These findings suggest that environmental, agricultural, and behavioral factors may play a critical role in inducing the observed seasonal pattern, likely through increased outdoor activities, animal contact, and consumption of contaminated food products. Given the regularity of the seasonal pattern, health authorities should focus on implementing targeted preventive measures, including promoting awareness, improving hygiene practices, and enhancing surveillance and control efforts during the high transmission season.

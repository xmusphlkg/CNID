Seasonal Patterns:

Based on the monthly data for cholera cases in mainland China before August 2023, it is evident that there is a distinct seasonal pattern in the occurrence of cases. Cholera cases are more prevalent during the summer months and decrease during the winter months. This aligns with the known transmission patterns of cholera, as the bacteria responsible for the disease thrive in warm water and contaminated food, which are typically more abundant during the summer.

Peak and Trough Periods:

The peak period for cholera cases in mainland China is observed during the summer months, particularly in July and August. During these months, there is a notable surge in the number of cases, with the highest recorded value in August 2010, when 63 cases were reported. Conversely, the trough period for cholera cases is observed during the winter months, from December to February, in which consistently very few or even zero cases are reported.

Overall Trends:

Examining the overall trend of cholera cases in mainland China before August 2023, there is a general fluctuation in the number of cases from year to year. The number of cases ranges from 0 to 18 per month, with sporadic spikes in certain months. However, there is no clear upward or downward trend observed over the years. It is important to note that the data for 2023 is incomplete, as it only includes data up to August.

The seasonal patterns of cholera cases in mainland China underscore the significance of understanding the environmental factors that contribute to the disease's transmission. In this case, the increase in cases during the summer months can be attributed to factors such as warmer temperatures and elevated water and food contamination. This information can be invaluable for public health authorities when planning and implementing targeted interventions to prevent and control cholera outbreaks in mainland China.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the overall trend of cholera cases does not exhibit a consistent pattern of increase or decrease over time. This suggests the possibility of other influencing factors, including variations in reporting or surveillance systems, changes in population vulnerability, or the effectiveness of cholera prevention and control measures. Further analysis and investigation are necessary to identify and comprehend these factors, ultimately leading to the development of more effective strategies for cholera prevention and control in mainland China.

Discussion:

Filariasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasite infection transmitted through mosquito vectors, has been seemingly well-controlled and contained in mainland China, as evidenced by the consistent low incidence of cases and deaths. However, it is important to note that a lack of reported cases and deaths does not necessarily guarantee an absence of the disease. Unreported or misdiagnosed cases could potentially exist, and continuous surveillance is necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the scope of the disease burden in mainland China. Furthermore, efforts need to be sustained and enhanced to bolster existing control measures to prevent potential resurgences of the disease in the future.

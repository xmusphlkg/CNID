Factors such as surveillance efforts, reporting practices, and control measures implemented by public health authorities can significantly influence the number of reported cases and deaths.

To minimize the impact of any potential outbreaks and protect public health, it is essential for epidemiologists and public health officials to closely monitor the situation for any emerging trends or changes in H5N1 infections in Chinese mainland. Timely surveillance, effective prevention measures, and rapid response are critical.

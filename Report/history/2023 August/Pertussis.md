Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, noticeable seasonal patterns emerge in the number of Pertussis cases in mainland China. The cases reach their highest levels during the summer months (June to August) and their lowest levels during the winter months (December to February). 

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Pertussis cases occurs in August, with 4793 cases reported in August 2023. This is followed by July, with 2767 cases in the same year. The trough period typically occurs during the winter months, particularly in January and February, when lower case numbers are reported. 

Overall Trends: 
When examining the overall trend of Pertussis cases from 2010 to August 2023, an increasing trend in the number of cases over time is apparent, with some fluctuations. The number of cases steadily increased from 2010 to reach a peak in 2018, when 4134 cases were reported in August of that year. After 2018, there seems to have been a slight decline in cases, followed by a modest increase in recent years, with 4388 cases reported in August 2019 and 4793 cases reported in August 2023. 

Discussion: 
The observed seasonal patterns in Pertussis cases in mainland China suggest that specific factors may contribute to the transmission of the disease during certain times of the year. Factors such as increased social interactions and gatherings during the summer months, along with a higher likelihood of respiratory infections, could contribute to the higher case numbers during this period. Conversely, lower temperatures and reduced social interactions during the winter months may contribute to the lower case numbers observed during that time.

The overall increasing trend in cases throughout the years may be attributed to various factors, including improved surveillance and reporting systems, increased awareness and testing for Pertussis, changes in population demographics, and fluctuations in vaccination coverage and effectiveness. Further analysis should be conducted to better understand the underlying factors driving these trends and to inform targeted interventions for the prevention and control of Pertussis in mainland China.

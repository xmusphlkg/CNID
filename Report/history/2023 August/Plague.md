Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the provided data, it is apparent that there are no discernible seasonal patterns in the occurrence of Plague cases and deaths in Chinese mainland. The number of cases and deaths fluctuate randomly throughout the years, without any observable consistent patterns.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The data does not allow for distinct identification of peak and trough periods as the number of cases and deaths remain low and infrequent. Although there have been several instances of slight increases in the number of cases and deaths, such as in August 2010, August 2014, and August 2023, they do not exhibit any consistent trends or significant spikes.

Overall Trends:
From 2010 to August 2023, the frequency of cases and deaths resulting from Plague in Chinese mainland have been sporadic and relatively low. There is no discernible upward or downward trend, and the pattern of incidence lacks consistency with no significant increase over time.

Discussion:
The available data suggests that Plague has been of minimal concern within Chinese mainland as only occasional cases and deaths have been documented. Despite the extended time frame of the dataset, the frequency of cases and deaths has remained low. This may indicate that successful preventative measures have been implemented to avoid widespread outbreaks. However, a more comprehensive analysis of additional data may be necessary to confirm this conclusion and identify the contributing factors that influence the occurrence of Plague within Chinese mainland.

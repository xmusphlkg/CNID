Seasonal Patterns:
Analysis of monthly data on Rabies cases and deaths in Chinese mainland reveals a distinct seasonal pattern. The incidence of cases and deaths is generally low during winter (December to February), increases in spring (March to May), peaks in summer (June to August), and gradually declines in autumn (September to November).

Peak and Trough Periods:
The highest number of Rabies cases and deaths in Chinese mainland occurs during the summer months, specifically in July and August. Conversely, the lowest incidence of cases and deaths is observed during the winter months, particularly December to February.

Overall Trends:
Examining the overall trends, fluctuations in the number of Rabies cases and deaths are apparent over the years. From 2010 to 2013, there is an upward trend in cases and deaths, followed by a gradual decrease from 2014 to 2020. However, starting from 2020, there is a slight increase in cases and deaths.

Discussion:
The seasonal pattern of Rabies cases and deaths in Chinese mainland suggests a probable correlation with warmer weather. The peak and trough periods correspond with the summer and winter months, respectively. This aligns with the known transmission dynamics of Rabies, as increased outdoor activities and human-animal interactions during summer may heighten the risk of exposure.

The overall trend of increasing cases and deaths from 2010 to 2013, followed by a gradual decrease from 2014 to 2020, may be attributed to various factors, including public health interventions like vaccination campaigns and educational programs. Additionally, improvements in animal control and preventive measures could have contributed. However, the slight increase in cases and deaths from 2020 onwards suggests the necessity for ongoing surveillance and intervention efforts to curb further disease spread.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided monthly data on Rabies cases and deaths up until August 2023 in Chinese mainland. Further data and analysis are required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors influencing the observed patterns and trends in Rabies epidemiology within the region.

## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is an advanced stage of infection caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The virus primarily attacks the immune system, leading to its gradual deterioration, making the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and diseases. Transmitted through certain body fluids, the disease can lead to critical illnesses, including infections and cancers. With no definitive cure, the focus is predominantly on antiretroviral treatment to manage the disease and prolong the lives of individuals living with HIV.

## Highlights

- Increasing trend over the decade: Data reveals a persistent upward trend in AIDS cases and deaths across the years, signaling a worsening epidemic in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
- Peak in late 2018: A notable spike in cases and deaths, particularly in December 2018, highlights a potential outbreak or management issues at that time. <br/>
- Variability in reporting: Monthly fluctuations could indicate reporting inconsistencies, healthcare access challenges, or seasonal diagnosis trends. <br/>
- Persistent high mortality in 2023: Despite fluctuations, the death rate in December 2023 remains significantly high, reflecting continued difficulties in treatment or prevention measures. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The number of reported AIDS cases in China's mainland from December 2013 to December 2023 displays a concerning upward trend over the decade. Though fluctuations are noticeable with certain months experiencing lower cases, like January 2014 (2,245 cases), a general increase is evident, especially towards the end of each year. December consistently reports higher cases, with December 2023 registering 5,295 cases. An alarming escalation is observed from 4,404 cases in December 2013 to a peak of 7,897 cases in December 2018, suggesting an urgent need for enhanced preventive measures.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to AIDS in the same period also follow an increasing pattern, albeit with some irregularities. There is a distinct hike in fatalities particularly towards the latter part of the analyzed period, with December 2023 witnessing 2,068 deaths. The mortality figures peak significantly in December 2021, with 2,486 deaths. The data reveals a higher death rate during the colder months, particularly from October to December. Despite medical advancements, the increasing death toll — from 1,336 in December 2013 to 2,068 in December 2023 — indicates persisting challenges in treatment efficacy and access to care.

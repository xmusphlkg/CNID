## Introduction

Anthrax is a serious, life-threatening, infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Primarily a disease in animals, it can also infect humans exposed to tissue from infected animals, animal products, or directly spores. There are four types of infection: cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal, and injection. Symptoms vary depending on the type of exposure, but all forms can potentially progress to serious disease or death if not treated. Antibiotics are used to treat anthrax, and a vaccine is available for high-risk populations.

## Highlights

- Notable peaks in Anthrax cases during summer, with the highest number of cases (123) in August 2023, reflecting potential environmental or occupational relations. <br/>
- Fluctuation in annual case numbers with significant increases seen in 2017, 2018, and 2021, though fatality rates remain low, indicating effective control measures. <br/>
- Despite the highest case count in August 2023, no deaths were recorded, suggesting advancements in medical treatment or reporting practices. <br/>
- Mortality is infrequent, with the highest number of deaths being two in some months, signifying efficient anthrax prevention strategies. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between December 2013 and December 2023, Anthrax cases in the Chinese mainland displayed seasonal patterns with peaks mostly in July and August each year. July 2021 and August 2023 saw the highest number of cases, with 66 and 123 respectively, suggesting possible increased exposure risk during these periods. While cases were generally below 30 per month, intermittent spikes demonstrate the need for ongoing surveillance. Consistent reporting of cases per month suggests active case finding and reporting systems.

### Deaths Analysis
Anthrax-related deaths in the Chinese mainland remained rare over the decade, suggesting either a low virulence strain or effective medical response. Deaths occurred sporadically, with a small increase during the summer months, consistent with the rise in cases. The highest death count was two in a month, seen occasionally in July, August, and December of certain years. The mortality rate over this time was low, indicating effective treatment strategies are likely in place following Anthrax diagnoses.

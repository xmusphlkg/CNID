## Introduction

Cholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is transmitted through contaminated water or food, primarily in regions with inadequate sanitation and water treatment. Symptoms include severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, which can lead to death if untreated. Despite being preventable and treatable, Cholera remains a significant public health issue in many developing countries, with millions of cases reported annually globally, often linked to poverty and lack of infrastructure.

## Highlights

- Seasonal cholera patterns observed, with peak incidence in warmer months (May to October), indicating a climate-related influence. <br/>
- Zero fatalities from 2013 to December 2023 suggest effective case management and possibly rapid containment measures. <br/>
- A modest increase in cases since 2018, with the highest being 12 in August 2018; cases remain low with 9 in September 2023. <br/>
- Repeated zero-case months during winter imply occasional successful suppression or potential underreporting. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data spanning from December 2013 to December 2023 shows sporadic occurrences of cholera cases on the Chinese mainland with no reported fatalities. Annual case counts exhibited a seasonal pattern peaking during the summer to early fall months, July through October, indicative of this period's higher risk for cholera transmission. There was a noticeable increase in cases beginning in 2014, with numbers remaining relatively low but consistent over the years. The highest monthly case counts occurred in August 2018, July 2022, and September 2023, suggesting a need for targeted preventive measures during these high-risk months.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the assessed period, no cholera-associated deaths were reported, highlighting the potential effectiveness of public health interventions, such as access to treatment and clean water, timely disease surveillance, and health education initiatives. The consistent lack of fatalities suggests a successfully managed health system for cholera with respect to rapid identification and treatment of cases. However, it remains important to maintain diligent disease control practices and continue public health surveillance to keep mortality at zero and address any potential outbreaks.

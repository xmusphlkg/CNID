## Introduction

Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, primarily affecting the mucous membranes of the throat and nose. It spreads through respiratory droplets or by touching infected objects. Symptoms typically include a sore throat, fever, swollen glands, and a thick, gray membrane covering the back of the throat. Severe cases can potentially lead to breathing difficulties, heart failure, or paralysis. Vaccination is highly effective and crucial as a preventive measure. Without treatment, diphtheria can be deadly.

## Highlights

- Diphtheria has maintained a very low incidence in the Chinese mainland over the past decade, with only sporadic cases and no reported deaths. <br/>
- There has been a total of six cases since 2016, with a single case reported in certain years (2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023), indicating sporadic occurrences rather than persistent transmission. <br/>
- The absence of deaths suggests either mild manifestations of the disease, effective treatment protocols, or possibly underreporting. <br/>
- The distribution of cases does not show a clear seasonal pattern, implying that the incidences are likely due to individual exposure events or very small, contained outbreaks. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From December 2013 to December 2023, the Chinese mainland reported a total of 5 cases of diphtheria with no systematic pattern or seasonal trend. All cases were isolated incidents occurring in separate years: October 2016, June 2018, August and September 2020, July 2021, and June 2023. The data suggests an extremely low incidence rate of diphtheria over the 10-year span, indicating successful control measures such as widespread vaccination and public health surveillance. In addition, the absence of clusters or outbreaks suggests effective immediate containment of the few cases that emerged.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, there have been zero reported deaths from diphtheria, which corroborates the low number of cases and implies a 100% survival rate for those infected. The absence of fatalities reflects the effectiveness of treatment protocols and healthcare access for those few who were affected. The data highlights the success of China's healthcare infrastructure in managing and treating diphtheria, a potentially fatal disease if left untreated, further underscoring the efficiency of preventive measures like the DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) vaccination program.

Please note that this analysis assumes the data provided is accurate and comprehensive. Any underreporting or failure to diagnose diphtheria would influence the conclusions drawn.

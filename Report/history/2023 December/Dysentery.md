## Introduction

Dysentery is an infectious disease caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites, predominantly Shigella species and Entamoeba histolytica, leading to severe diarrhea with mucus or blood. This globally prevalent disease is primarily transmitted through ingesting food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. It is most common in areas with poor sanitation and typically affects children, particularly in developing countries. If untreated, it may lead to severe dehydration, malnutrition, or even death. Effectual prevention includes improved sanitation and adequate water treatment.

## Highlights

- Seasonal variation in dysentery cases is evident with peaks typically observed in summer months (June, July, August) and troughs in winter (December, January, February). <br/>
- Total dysentery cases have been decreasing over the analyzed decade, with a significant decline post-2017, indicating potential improvements in sanitation, awareness, or reporting. <br/>
- The death toll associated with dysentery remains low, with occasional single fatalities reported sporadically, suggesting that although the illness is prevalent, it is rarely fatal, likely due to effective treatment regimens. <br/>
- The latest available data from December 2023 shows a continued low number of dysentery cases (1727) and no deaths, aligning with the overall declining trend in disease incidence.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Dysentery cases on Chinese mainland from December 2013 to December 2023 show marked seasonality with peaks during the summer months, indicating a possible correlation with factors such as temperature and hygiene practices. A concerning uptrend was observed between December 2013 and July 2014, reaching 22,311 cases, followed by a general decline over the years. However, an overall decreasing trend in cases is seen from a peak in 2014 to lesser numbers towards the end of the dataset, suggesting improvements in prevention, control measures, or reporting practices.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to dysentery from December 2013 to December 2023 in China has remained low, with a total of 23 deaths reported over the 10-year period, despite variations in case numbers. The mortality rate due to dysentery is sporadic, with some months reporting one or two deaths, and many months reporting zero. The highest number of deaths in a single month was three, in July 2015. This suggests a relatively low case-fatality rate and potentially effective clinical management of dysentery cases.

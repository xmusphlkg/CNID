## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a parasitic infection caused by the Echinococcus genus of tapeworms. This zoonotic condition primarily affects the liver and lungs, but can spread to other organs. Humans get infected through ingestion of parasite eggs in contaminated food, water, or exposure to infected animal feces. Once ingested, the eggs hatch and form cysts in the organs, leading to complications. It's prevalent in regions where domestic livestock rearing is common, including parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and the Middle East. Infection can be prevented by good hygiene practices and regular deworming of animals.

## Highlights

- Echinococcosis cases in mainland China show a significant decline from a peak of 1077 in March 2017 to consistent monthly reports around 300 cases by the end of 2023. <br/>
- A notable case reduction occurred in early 2020; this drop could correspond with the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent health interventions, but cases resumed to prior levels shortly after. <br/>
- There is minimal mortality, with deaths sporadically reported throughout the observed years and none in 2023, which may signify improved disease management or under-reporting. <br/>
- The current situation as of December 2023 demonstrates a stabilized prevalence with managed mortality rates. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Echinococcosis cases in mainland China from December 2013 to December 2023 show a fluctuating pattern with notable peaks and troughs. An initial increase is observed from December 2013 (406 cases) with sporadic rises reaching the highest reported cases in March 2017 (1077 cases). Cases generally ranged between 200-500 per month with occasional spikes. Post-2017, a gradual decline is evident, notably in 2022 with cases frequently falling below 300. This downtrend continued into 2023, maintaining a moderate caseload between 240 and 387 cases monthly, potentially indicating improved control measures.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the decade, Echinococcosis-related fatalities in the Chinese mainland were minimal, with recorded deaths only in six instances out of 121 months. The first reported death occurred in July 2015, followed by a single death in several scattered months of 2016, 2019, and 2020. There was a slight increase in February 2019 with two deaths. Despite low general mortality, the presence of fatalities underscores the disease's potential risk and the importance of continuous monitoring and intervention efforts.

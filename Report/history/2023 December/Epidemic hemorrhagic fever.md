## Introduction

Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) is a severe infectious disease primarily caused by two groups of related viruses, Hantavirus and Arenaviruses. Transmission occurs through contact with infected rodents or their droppings. Symptoms may include high fever, bleeding disorders, and kidney damage. Crucially, this is a zoonotic disease, implying humans contract it from animals. EHF cases are often seen in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. However, its occurrence is sporadic and often linked to environmental changes that affect rodent populations. Effective treatment and vaccine are currently lacking.

## Highlights

- Cases of Epidemic hemorrhagic fever in China show clear seasonal peaks in winter months, with a consistent yearly decline towards late summer. <br/>
- The mortality rate fluctuates, with notable spikes such as December 2017's peak of 22 deaths. Recent trends indicate an overall decline in both cases and fatalities. <br/>
- The latest data for December 2023 reveals 1122 cases and a single death, suggesting maintained disease presence with a currently low fatality rate. <br/>
- Ongoing monitoring and preventive measures seem crucial, especially during high-risk periods, to sustain the declining trend in disease impact.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever in the Chinese mainland from December 2013 to December 2023 shows a marked seasonality, with case counts typically peaking in the colder months towards the end of the year. Notably, November and December recurrently exhibit higher numbers of cases, with peaks in November 2017, November 2018, and December 2021. The trend suggests an environmental or behavioral seasonal factor driving transmission. A decline in cases is evident in the warmer months, with the lowest counts often occurring between July and September each year.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths associated with Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever exhibits variability but does not strictly parallel the number of cases. The highest mortality was recorded in November 2018. The overall case fatality rate fluctuates, but it is worth noting that despite the high number of cases in certain periods, such as December 2021 with 2402 cases, the mortality did not exceed the peak of 33 deaths as seen in November 2018. This could indicate improved clinical management or reporting accuracy over time. The data also presents sporadic months with zero deaths, suggesting possible improvements in preventive measures or health interventions.

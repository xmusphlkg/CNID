## Introduction

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus. It is usually transmitted person-to-person through the fecal-oral route or consumption of contaminated food or water. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, lasting several weeks to several months. While not typically as serious as other types of viral hepatitis, it can cause acute liver failure, which is often fatal. Vaccination is the best way to prevent Hepatitis A, particularly for those traveling to regions with high rates of the disease.

## Highlights

- A consistent decline in reported Hepatitis A cases is observed from 2013 to 2023, indicating improved control and possibly better vaccination coverage. <br/>
- The mortality associated with Hepatitis A remains very low, with many months reporting zero deaths, suggesting effective case management and a mild disease course. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns are not strongly evident in the data, as case numbers fluctuate without clear seasonal trends, which may relate to the establishment of herd immunity or other intervening factors. <br/>
- The sporadic occurrences of death over the years, albeit rare, highlight the need for continued vigilance in high-risk populations and sustained public health efforts.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Hepatitis A cases in Chinese mainland from December 2013 to December 2023 shows fluctuations with a peak in cases during 2014, gradually decreasing over the years. The highest monthly case count of 2733 occurred in December 2014, while the lowest was 523 in January 2023, illustrating a downward trend over the decade. An initial increase in cases was observed until 2014, followed by an overall decline with minor periodic increases, suggesting improvements in preventing the disease, possibly through enhanced vaccination and better sanitation practices.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the years 2013 to 2023, Hepatitis A deaths remained low, with monthly figures never exceeding 4 deaths. A total of 24 deaths associated with Hepatitis A were reported, with the highest annual count of 7 deaths occurring in 2015. Several months reported zero deaths, highlighting the comparatively low mortality rate associated with the disease during the observed period. Notably, there were no deaths in any month after September 2022, suggesting further enhancement of healthcare intervention and management of Hepatitis A in Chinese mainland.

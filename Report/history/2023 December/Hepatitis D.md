## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as Delta Hepatitis, is a serious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis D Virus (HDV). It is unique as it can only infect individuals already infected with Hepatitis B, leading to severe or potentially life-threatening complications. Transmission commonly occurs through direct contact with infected blood or bodily fluids. Symptoms include fatigue, jaundice, and abdominal pain. The disease can cause both acute and chronic infection, with chronic hepatitis D leading to more severe outcomes such as cirrhosis or liver cancer.

## Highlights

- A steady decline in Hepatitis D cases from 2016, stabilizing under 30 monthly cases since 2020. <br/>
- No fatalities reported, suggesting effective disease management and potentially improved healthcare responses. <br/>
- Incidence in 2023 appears stable with minor fluctuations, case numbers ranging from 14 to 23 monthly. <br/>
- Data may indicate successful public health measures and vaccination strategies contributing to the controlled prevalence of the disease. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Hepatitis D case data for Chinese Mainland during 2016-2023 indicates a consistent presence of the infection with low endemicity. Cases peaked at 60 in January 2016 and showed variability without a clear trend over the years, averaging around 30-40 cases monthly. A notable decrease occurred starting 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic onset, which could imply changes in transmission dynamics or underreporting due to overshadowed healthcare priorities. The data exhibits sporadic monthly fluctuations, yet consistently maintains low case numbers, indicating potential stabilization of the disease's spread or effective public health interventions.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the reported period from 2016 to 2023, there have been zero reported deaths due to Hepatitis D in Chinese Mainland. This consistently null death count could suggest that while Hepatitis D infections do occur, they may be of milder nature, managed effectively with existing healthcare provisions, or that cases do not progress to fulminant hepatic failure. The lack of mortality highlights either the non-lethal nature of the infections during this period or could reflect underreporting. Zero mortalities also imply that, regarding public health outcomes, the focus may be more on prevention and control rather than high fatality management.

## Introduction

Hepatitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the liver, typically caused by viral infections of types A, B, C, D, or E. Each variant has different transmission routes, from consuming contaminated food or water to direct contact with infected bodily fluids. Chronic forms of Hepatitis, like B and C, can lead to long-term health problems including liver cirrhosis or cancer. Other non-infectious causes of hepatitis include autoimmune diseases or exposure to certain chemicals or medications. Vaccines are available for types A and B.

## Highlights

- Fluctuating hepatitis cases with peaks in March 2018 and March 2023, but a significant dip observed in December 2022. <br/>
- Deaths from hepatitis surged notably in 2023, culminating in a high of 428 deaths in December 2023, pointing to increased virulence or better reporting. <br/>
- An alarming rise in mortality rates in 2023, with a stark increase from May onwards, signifies an escalating severity towards year-end. <br/>
- Despite the years of data analysis, the recent spike in mortality signals an urgent need for public health intervention. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows a fluctuating trend in hepatitis cases across the years on the Chinese mainland. A significant monthly variability in case numbers is observed, with peaks generally in March, indicating potential seasonality. The highest recorded cases were in December 2023 with 143,778 cases, while the lowest occurred in December 2022 with 72,630 cases. A sudden dip in February 2020 (63,330 cases) coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic onset, suggesting possible impacts on healthcare reporting or service accessibility. The recent surge in cases from January to December 2023 indicates an emerging healthcare concern.

### Deaths Analysis
Hepatitis mortality in the Chinese mainland has followed an upward trajectory, especially in the latter half of the observed period. Deaths remained relatively low and stable until 2022, averaging around 50 per month. However, a stark increase is seen from 2023 onwards, with deaths climbing rapidly to 428 by December 2023. This sharp growth signifies a worsening situation, either due to increased virulence, reporting changes, reduced vaccine efficacy, healthcare strain, or a combination of these factors. The increased death rate demands immediate investigation and potential action to mitigate the underlying causes.

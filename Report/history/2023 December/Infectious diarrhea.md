## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea, often referred to as gastroenteritis, is a common health issue primarily caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites present in contaminated food or water. Common pathogens include Norovirus, E. coli, Salmonella, and Giardia. Symptom onset typically occurs between a few hours to a few days post-exposure, initiating with abdominal cramps, nausea, followed by diarrhea. Due to fluid loss, severe cases may lead to dehydration. Though mostly self-limiting within a few days, vulnerable groups such as infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals might need medical intervention.

## Highlights

- Seasonal fluctuation seen with cases peaking typically during winter (January) and summer (July-August), indicating a pattern consistent with varying transmission dynamics across seasons. <br/>
- A general decline in the number of cases and deaths observed starting from the end of 2021, which may be indicative of effective control measures or changes in population immunity. <br/>
- Notably, there have been no reported deaths since February 2021, which could reflect improvements in clinical care, public health interventions, or reporting accuracy. <br/>
- The drop in cases and deaths may also suggest successful implementation of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) initiatives, vaccination, and/or outbreak response strategies. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Infectious diarrhea cases in Mainland China showed high seasonality, with peaks typically in winter and summer months. From December 2013 to December 2023, cases ranged from 29,010 to 186,071. The highest recorded month was January 2018 with 186,071 cases, indicating possible outbreaks or seasonal surges. The data suggests a possible trend towards reduced incidence in more recent years, with the lowest number of 29,010 cases in December 2022, but this could also reflect reporting differences or successful interventions.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality associated with infectious diarrhea from December 2013 to December 2023 was extremely low, with deaths per month never exceeding 7. Despite fluctuations in case numbers, deaths remained rare, with many months reporting zero fatalities. This suggests effective management of the disease and possibly a non-virulent strain or good access to healthcare facilities. The data does reveal occasional spikes in deaths, such as July 2014 with 7 deaths, which could warrant further examination for cause and risk factors.

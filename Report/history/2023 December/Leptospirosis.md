## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. Caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira, it's transmitted through the urine of infected animals which can contaminate water and soil. In humans, it can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, and respiratory distress. Symptoms commonly include high fever, severe headache, chills, muscle aches, and vomiting. The disease is most commonly found in a tropical climate but can occur anywhere. Early detection through appropriate diagnostic tests can prevent severe health problems.

## Highlights

- Seasonal peaks in summer and early autumn, with August and September typically seeing the highest cases, indicate environmental or activity-related spread. <br/>
- Yearly case numbers vary without a clear long-term trend, but 2014 and 2021 had notably higher peaks. <br/>
- Mortality is low, with most months recording zero deaths, suggesting effective management or mild infection strains. <br/>
- Data from 2023 show lower cases with no deaths, indicating current control; continued surveillance for seasonal spikes is recommended. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Leptospirosis cases in mainland China exhibit seasonal fluctuation, peaking annually between June and October, coinciding with warmer, wetter conditions conducive to disease spread. Over the decade, there was a noticeable spike in December 2014, with 207 cases. The data suggests a downward trend in the number of cases per year, especially notable from 2014 through 2023, though some fluctuations occur. There are occasional outlying months with increased cases, but the general pattern is consistent with expected seasonal outbreaks of the disease.

### Deaths Analysis
Death occurrences from leptospirosis in China within the reviewed period were infrequent but present, with zero to four deaths per month when they occurred. September 2014 and October 2020 had the highest reported fatalities, with four deaths each. There is an absence of a clear trend in mortality, yet deaths were slightly more common in the latter half of the year, mirroring the case trend. Overall, the mortality rate remained low, suggesting either underreporting, effective management strategies, or a non-virulent strain of Leptospira.

## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Predominantly present in tropical and subtropical climates, it causes symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and vomiting, which show up 10-15 days after the mosquito bite. There are five parasite species responsible for malaria in humans, out of which Plasmodium falciparum is the most deadly. The World Health Organization estimates millions of malaria cases annually, resulting in several hundred thousand deaths, primarily affecting children in Africa.

## Highlights

- Significant decline in malaria cases from 386 in June 2015 to 245 in December 2023, indicating effective disease control efforts. <br/>
- Deaths are consistently low, typically 0 to 2 per month, reflecting strong medical treatment capacity. <br/>
- Slight uptrend from 26 cases in January 2022 to 245 cases in December 2023 may suggest resurgence or seasonal increase. <br/>
- Higher summertime cases could point to seasonal transmission, meriting further study for targeted interventions. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the reported period from December 2013 to December 2023, malaria cases in Chinese mainland displayed a significant decline, especially from 2020 onwards. Initial years fluctuated between 169 to 386 cases per month, indicative of seasonal variability and possible outbreak controls. After January 2020, there was a marked decrease in cases, dropping to two digits, with a further decline observed from the start of 2022. This trend possibly reflects effective malaria interventions and the impact of broader public health measures, though recent months suggest a slight rebound in cases.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll associated with malaria from December 2013 through December 2023 has low variability, with monthly fatalities rarely exceeding 5 deaths. Notably, there was no death recorded in many months from 2020 onwards, signifying effective case management and prevention strategies. A high mortality was recorded in June 2014 and December 2019, with 5 and 4 deaths respectively, suggesting sporadic severe incidents. The overall trend, however, indicates successful mortality reduction indicating progress toward malaria elimination in the region.

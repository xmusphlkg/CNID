## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the measles virus. It is primarily spread through direct contact and the air, starting with a fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes followed by a characteristic red rash. While usually mild in children, it can lead to serious complications such as encephalitis, pneumonia, and even death. Despite available vaccines providing effective immunity, measles remains a significant cause of mortality worldwide, especially among young children.

## Highlights

- Measles cases in China have shown a significant decline since the peak in 2014. After reaching highest numbers in April 2014 with 11,089 cases, thereâ€™s been a marked decrease in reported cases each year. <br/>
- From 2020 onwards, the incidence of measles has consistently remained below 200 cases per month, indicating better control of the disease. <br/>
- No measles-related deaths have been reported since January 2016, reflecting improvements in disease management and possibly vaccination coverage. <br/>
- In December 2023, the reported measles cases totaled 69, maintaining the trend of low case counts observed over the recent years. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
After peaking in April 2014 with 11,089 cases, measles incidents in the Chinese mainland have displayed a marked decrease, stabilizing at low levels (<200 cases/month) by 2019. The trend reveals effective control, likely through vaccination and public health strategies. Intriguingly, cases reached a nadir in 2020, possibly influenced by COVID-19-related movement restrictions and increased hygiene measures. Since then, the number of cases has maintained a steady low, with only minor fluctuations observed, suggesting sustained control of measles transmission in the population.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to measles have been effectively minimized, showing only sporadic occurrences after 2015, with no fatalities reported since February 2016. The initial period of data (2013 December - 2015 February) indicated occasional fatalities, concurrently with higher case counts. A noted decline in deaths aligns with reduced case frequency and improved healthcare responses. The data is indicative of improved measles management and the potential impact of enhanced immunization coverage and advanced clinical care practices in preventing measles-associated mortality.

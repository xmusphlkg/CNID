## Introduction

Monkeypox is a rare and infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, primarily found in central and west Africa. It is similar to human smallpox, although typically milder. The disease manifests as fever, headaches, muscle aches, chills, and a distinctive rash. It spreads through direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals or humans. Infections can also result from eating inadequately cooked meat from infected animals. Currently, there is no specific treatment for monkeypox.


## Highlights

- There has been a noticeable fluctuation in the number of monkeypox cases per month in Chinese mainland, without any fatalities reported as of December 2023. <br/>
- The highest count of cases was recorded in October 2023, with 127 infections. This peak was followed by a decrease in November, indicating potential effectiveness of public health interventions. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, the persistence of cases from September through December suggests continued transmission within the population. <br/>
- The absence of deaths indicates that the outbreak may involve less severe forms of the disease or that healthcare responses are managing to prevent fatal outcomes effectively.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The number of Monkeypox cases in the Chinese mainland saw a notable fluctuation over the last four months of 2023. An initial count of 80 cases in September was followed by a significant increase to 127 cases in October, suggesting a peak of the outbreak or improved case detection. However, cases retreated back to 80 in November, indicating a possible control of the outbreak or seasonal variation. December saw a moderate increase again to 102 cases, which could reflect a resurgence or continued transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the reported period from September to December 2023, the death toll remained consistent at zero. This indicates a non-fatal course for the Monkeypox cases in the Chinese mainland, which could be attributed to factors such as effective medical interventions, a less virulent strain, or the health system's adequate response. The absence of mortality may also suggest successful containment measures and could signal the effectiveness of public health measures implemented in response to the outbreak.

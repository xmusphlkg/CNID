## Introduction

Other Hepatitis refers to a group of infectious diseases affecting the liver, primarily caused by various hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, and E). Notable for their diverse transmission methods, symptoms, and severity, these viral infections can lead to chronic or acute illnesses â€” ranging from mild conditions lasting a few weeks to serious lifelong issues and death. Some types are preventable via vaccination. Attention to this field is crucial to control outbreaks, reduce transmission, and develop effective treatments.

## Highlights

- Overall decline in both cases and deaths due to Other hepatitis from 2013 to 2023, with a noticeable dip in early 2020. <br/>
- Deaths are rare, with several months reporting zero deaths, indicating the condition may be becoming less lethal or better managed. <br/>
- The significant drop in cases in February 2020 could be associated with the COVID-19 lockdowns, which may have reduced the transmission of infectious diseases, including hepatitis. <br/>
- Since the beginning of 2020, the number of cases has remained relatively low compared to previous years, suggesting potential improvements in public health measures or disease awareness and prevention.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data exhibit a substantial decline in 'Other hepatitis' cases in the Chinese mainland from 2013 to 2023. December 2013 had 2883 cases, which steadily declined to 612 cases by December 2023. The most significant drop occurred from January 2020 (878 cases) to February 2020 (404 cases), possibly indicating an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare access or reporting. Periodic fluctuations are apparent, but the overall trend remains decidedly downward.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths associated with 'Other hepatitis' over the years is relatively low, with most months reporting zero or one death. A peak in mortality is observed in March 2014 with four deaths. From 2014 through 2023, the deaths per month rarely exceeded one, with no deaths in the majority of months from 2016 onwards. This suggests a low fatality rate or effective management of the disease despite the varying number of cases reported.

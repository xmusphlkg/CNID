## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects children under the age of five. The virus spreads through fecal-oral contamination and replicates in the intestines, potentially infiltrating the nervous system causing paralysis. While a significant portion of polio infections are non-paralytic and resolve on their own, a small percentage can result in permanent disability or death. Vaccination is the most effective form of prevention and has significantly reduced the incidence of the disease worldwide.


## Highlights

- The data indicates that there have been no reported cases or deaths due to Poliomyelitis in Chinese mainland from December 2013 through December 2023. <br/>
- This trend suggests a sustained period of zero reported Poliomyelitis incidence over a decade, highlighting the effectiveness of public health measures and vaccination programs. <br/>
- The absence of fatalities associated with Poliomyelitis during this period further implies high levels of immunization coverage, considering the contagious nature of the virus. <br/>
- Given the historical presence of Poliomyelitis, ongoing surveillance and vaccination efforts must continue to ensure the disease remains eliminated from Chinese mainland.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The provided data for Poliomyelitis in the Chinese mainland spans a decade, from December 2013 to December 2023, and consistently reports zero cases. This consistent lack of reported cases is indicative of successful polio eradication efforts in the region. The sustained zero cases suggest effective vaccination programs, robust surveillance systems, and public health measures have maintained a polio-free status. Given the highly infectious nature of poliovirus and its capacity for outbreak, the absence of any reported cases in such a large population over this extended period is remarkable and signifies a public health triumph.

### Deaths Analysis
Corresponding to the zero reported cases of Poliomyelitis in the Chinese mainland, there have been zero deaths associated with the disease from December 2013 through December 2023. This data further testifies to the effectiveness of the polio eradication initiatives in place. It also reflects the sustained absence of both wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus transmission within the population. The death analysis underscores the successful maintenance of a polio-free environment and confirms the absence of any clinical complications or fatalities attributable to Poliomyelitis within this time frame.

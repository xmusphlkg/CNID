## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German measles, is a contagious viral disease characterized by rashes and fever. It's most severe when acquired during pregnancy, potentially causing serious birth defects or fetal death. Spread through airborne droplets from the nose or throat of an infected person, rubella's symptoms typically include mild fever, swollen glands, and a pink rash. Vaccination is the primary preventive measure, usually administered in childhood as part of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. Rubella is rare in many developed countries due to widespread vaccination.

## Highlights

- Rubella cases in Chinese mainland have significantly declined since a peak of 9,095 in May 2019, now averaging below 150 cases per month since January 2020. <br/>
- The data shows low mortality with only two reported deaths over the ten-year period, emphasizing the reduced severity or effective management of the disease. <br/>
- The recent trend from January to December 2023 indicates stable low incidence, with cases ranging from 40 to 110 per month and no reported deaths, reflecting ongoing effective disease surveillance and control efforts.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Rubella cases in Chinese mainland displayed considerable variation from 2013 to 2023, with notable peaks particularly during April and May. An alarming spike occurred in 2019, with cases exceeding 9,000 in May, representing the zenith of reported instances. Post-2019, the incidence sharply decreased, with a sustained overall downtrend to less than 200 cases monthly, possibly due to improved vaccination rates, heightened awareness, and effective public health measures. Seasonality is apparent in the data, with higher case numbers in spring seasons and a declining trend in recent years.

### Deaths Analysis
The data indicates a remarkably low mortality rate associated with rubella, showing only two reported deaths amidst tens of thousands of cases over the decade. Both deaths occurred in peak transmission periods, in March 2015 and June 2019. These isolated fatalities underscore rubella's generally mild nature, but they also highlight possible complications requiring intervention. The rarity of deaths emphasizes the importance of continuous surveillance and vaccination efforts to maintain control over rubella and prevent worse outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women.

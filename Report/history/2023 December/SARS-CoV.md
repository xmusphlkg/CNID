## Introduction

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a viral strain responsible for causing an outbreak of dangerous respiratory illness in 2002-2003. Belonging to the family of coronaviruses, it originates in bats and palm civets, later transmitting to humans. The symptoms resemble pneumonia, causing high fever, shortness of breath, and coughing spells. SARS-CoV spread globally, primarily impacting Asia and North America. Scientists are sure about its containment in 2004, but continue observing any resurgence in mutated versions. This virus is known for its high mortality, hovering around 10%.

## Highlights

- No cases or deaths from SARS-CoV were reported in the Chinese mainland from December 2013 to December 2023, indicating successful control of the virus. <br/>
- The absence of new SARS-CoV infections over this decade implies effective public health strategies and possible virus extinction within the region. <br/>
- The consistency of zero cases suggests robust surveillance and containment measures have prevented SARS-CoV re-emergence. <br/>
- Ongoing vigilance is crucial to prevent potential future outbreaks and ensure rapid response to any SARS-CoV detection. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The provided dataset indicates no reported cases of SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) in the Chinese mainland from December 2013 to December 2023. This ten-year span encompasses the period after the conclusion of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak and precedes the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) which began in late 2019. The absence of cases suggests effective containment and surveillance post-SARS outbreak, reflecting a successful public health response to the prior epidemic.

### Deaths Analysis
Consistent with the absence of reported cases, there were zero deaths attributed to SARS-CoV in the Chinese mainland for the entire period of January 2014 to December 2023. The recorded fatality data aligns with case data, as no mortalities can occur in the absence of infections. This indicates a sustained elimination of the virus, attributed to strict public health measures, and suggesting no re-emergence of SARS-CoV during the mentioned timeframe.

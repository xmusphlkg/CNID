## Introduction

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma worms. It's prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in poor communities without access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Humans contract the disease by coming into contact with contaminated freshwater, where the minute larval forms of the parasite penetrate the skin. The worms mature in the human body and lay eggs which cause inflammation and damage to organs. It can lead to significant chronic illness including liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. Preventive treatment focuses on reducing disease transmission via mass drug administration.

## Highlights

- Significant decline in schistosomiasis cases since 2015, with occasional outbreaks such as the one in September 2017. <br/>
- No disease-related deaths reported since a single fatality in February 2020, indicating potential improvements in treatment and management.<br/>
- Low-level endemic transmission persists, with sporadic cases recorded each month throughout 2023.<br/>
- The current disease situation as of December 2023 remains under control with low case numbers and no recent fatalities.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows a significant fluctuation in schistosomiasis cases across Chinese mainland from December 2013 to December 2023. Notably, there was a sharp increase in cases from January 2015, peaking in November 2015 (10,481 cases), followed by a sharp decline. From 2017 onwards, case numbers generally remained low, with occasional smaller peaks, like September 2017 (1,166 cases). By 2023 case reporting is minimal, indicating a substantial reduction in schistosomiasis incidence or changes in surveillance and reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the reporting period, schistosomiasis-associated mortality remained nearly nonexistent in the dataset, with only one reported death occurring in February 2020. This low mortality rate may be indicative of effective treatment protocols, control measures, and possibly a focus on less severe cases. The available data indicate successful management of schistosomiasis from a mortality perspective in the Chinese mainland over the observed years.

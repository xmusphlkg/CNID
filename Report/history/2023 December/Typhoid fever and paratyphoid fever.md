## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are bacterial infections caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, respectively. Both illnesses are typically contracted through the consumption of contaminated food or water. Symptoms often include high fever, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea. If left untreated, they can become life-threatening. Typhoid is generally the more severe of the two diseases. Both illnesses are indicative of poor sanitation and are more common in regions where conditions facilitate the spread of the bacteria.

## Highlights

- A significant decrease in typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases in China, from 1,787 cases in September 2014 to 358 cases in December 2023, showing effective disease control. <br/>
- Fatalities remain low with sporadic single deaths; no rise in mortality despite fluctuations in monthly case numbers. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns peak from May to August, consistent with warmer months which favor transmission. <br/>
- The overall trend and reduction in cases suggest successful public health measures and improved disease management in the mainland. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Typhoid and paratyphoid fever in Chinese mainland display a predictable seasonal pattern with peaks typically in the summer months—June through August—indicative of higher transmission rates in warmer weather. Cases tapered off toward the end of each year and remained lower during the winter. Over the decade, there seems to be a slight declining trend from 2014 to 2023, with fluctuations. Notable high numbers were seen in September 2014 (1787 cases) and July 2015 (1358 cases), with a general decrease leading into 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality associated with Typhoid and paratyphoid fever remained extremely low, totaling 15 deaths out of tens of thousands of cases across the reported years. Notably, a single death was reported in several non-consecutive months, indicating sporadic fatal outcomes. The first recorded death occurred in October 2014, and the latest in October 2023. The incidence of deaths did not display a clear seasonal pattern, and there was no discernible trend in mortality rate over the observed period, suggesting consistent case-management and treatment efficacy.

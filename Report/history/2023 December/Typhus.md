## Introduction

Typhus is a disease caused by bacterial infections, primarily transmitted by parasites like lice, fleas, ticks, and mites. Two major types are murine typhus and epidemic typhus, linked to Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia prowazekii bacteria, respectively. Symptoms typically include high fever, headache, rash, and in severe cases, delirium and neurological problems. Diagnostic tests are vital, as symptoms are similar to other illnesses. Consequently, specific antibiotics are prescribed for treatment. Poor sanitation and close human contact facilitate the spread of typhus; hence, public health measures emphasizing cleanliness can help prevent outbreaks.

## Highlights

- Seasonal trends are apparent in typhus cases over the decade, with peaks during the warmer months (June to October) indicating higher transmission in these periods. <br/>
- Mortality is exceptionally low, suggesting effective treatment of identified cases or low virulence of the typhus strain present. <br/>
- Cases fluctuate annually without a clear long-term trend, signifying stable transmission and no major shifts towards increased control or outbreak. <br/>
- The year 2023 shows persistence of the disease with higher incidence in the warmer months, highlighting the need for continued preventative efforts. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data for Typhus in Chinese mainland from December 2013 to December 2023 indicates fluctuating patterns of incidence with seasonal variations. Cases range from a low of 20 in February 2018 to a high of 227 in September 2023, showing no clear trend of decrease or increase over the years. Occasional spikes are observed, particularly during summer and autumn months such as June through October, suggesting possible environmental or vector-related factors driving transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite fluctuations in case numbers of Typhus in Chinese mainland over a decade, mortality has remained exceedingly low with only two reported deaths among thousands of casesâ€”one in June 2014 and another in August 2015. This suggests either a non-lethal strain of Typhus or, more likely, effective treatment and management of cases. The constancy of a zero death count post-2015 indicates sustained medical response capabilities.

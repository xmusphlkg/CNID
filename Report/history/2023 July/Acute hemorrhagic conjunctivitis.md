Seasonal Patterns: Analysis of the available data indicates a noticeable seasonal pattern for Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) in mainland China. The highest number of cases occurs during the summer months (June, July, and August), while the lowest number is observed in the winter months (December, January, and February). These findings suggest that AHC is more prevalent during warm weather conditions.

Peak and Trough Periods: In mainland China, AHC cases reach their peak during the summer months, particularly in July. The data exhibits a significant increase in the number of cases during this period, with a reported 16,676 cases in July 2010. Conversely, the number of cases decreases during the winter months, resulting in a trough period.

Overall Trends: The patterns observed in AHC cases in mainland China demonstrate fluctuation over the years. The data indicates an overall increasing trend since 2010, with occasional peaks and dips in subsequent years. However, it is important to note that negative values are present in some months, suggesting possible inconsistencies or errors in data reporting.

Discussion: The observed seasonal patterns and peak periods suggest that climatic factors influence the prevalence of AHC in mainland China, with the disease being more common in the summer months. This finding aligns with prior studies that have linked AHC outbreaks to warmer weather conditions. The overall increase in the number of cases over the years may stem from several factors, including changes in surveillance practices, population dynamics, and the spread of the disease. Monitoring and addressing AHC outbreaks, particularly during peak periods, is crucial for public health authorities to effectively control the spread of the disease and safeguard public well-being.

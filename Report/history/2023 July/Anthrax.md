Seasonal Patterns in Anthrax Cases in Chinese mainland

An analysis of monthly data on Anthrax cases in Chinese mainland reveals a discernible seasonal pattern. Typically, there is an increase in the number of cases during the summer months and a decrease during the winter months. Specifically, a higher number of cases occur between May and August, while lower numbers are observed between November and February.

Peak and Trough Periods

In Chinese mainland, peak periods for Anthrax cases occur predominantly during the summer months, particularly in July and August. During these months, the number of cases reaches its pinnacle, with 115 cases reported in August 2021. Trough periods, with the lowest numbers of cases, are encountered mostly in the winter months, notably between November and February.

Overall Trends

An observation of the analyzed period reveals fluctuations in the number of Anthrax cases. However, there is a slight increasing trend present. Between 2010 and 2017, the number of cases appears relatively stable, with occasional spikes in certain years. However, since 2017, there has been a noticeable upward trend, especially in the years 2020 and 2021, with the highest numbers of reported cases.

Discussion

The seasonal patterns observed in Anthrax cases suggest that certain environmental factors or human behaviors may contribute to the transmission of the disease during specific times of the year. Further research is imperative to identify these factors and comprehend their impact on the occurrence of Anthrax cases.

The peak periods during the summer months may be linked to increased outdoor activities, exposing individuals to environments where Anthrax spores are more prevalent. High temperatures in summer may also grow and facilitate the survival of the Anthrax bacteria.

Trough periods during the winter months may be attributed to reduced outdoor activities and lower temperatures, which reduce the likelihood of exposure to Anthrax spores.

The overall increasing trend in Anthrax cases since 2017 is concerning and requires further investigation. The trend may result from various factors, including changes in ecological conditions, increased awareness and reporting of cases, or modifications in agricultural practices that may facilitate the transmission of the disease.

In conclusion, the analysis shows seasonal patterns in Anthrax cases in Chinese mainland, with peak periods in the summer months and trough periods in the winter months. There is also a discernible increasing trend in Anthrax cases since 2017. Understanding these patterns and trends is crucial for successful surveillance and control measures to prevent the spread of Anthrax in the future.

Seasonal Patterns: 

Upon examining the data, it is evident that there are distinguishable seasonal patterns in the occurrence of Anthrax cases in mainland China. From 2010 to 2023, there is a general increase in the number of cases during the summer months, specifically from July to August, followed by a subsequent decrease in the winter months. These findings suggest a peak in Anthrax cases during the summer season.

Peak and Trough Periods: 

The peak period for Anthrax cases in mainland China is consistently observed in July and August, during which the number of cases reaches its highest point. Conversely, the trough period, characterized by the lowest number of cases, is evident during the winter months, particularly in December and January.

Overall Trends: 

Throughout the entire study period, there is a discernible upward trend in the incidence of Anthrax cases in mainland China, with some yearly fluctuations. However, it is crucial to acknowledge a significant decrease in cases from 2013 to 2014, wherein the number of cases dropped to negative values. This anomaly may be attributed to data inconsistencies or reporting issues.

Discussion: 

The observed seasonal patterns imply that there may exist certain environmental factors or human activities during the summer months that contribute to the heightened transmission of Anthrax in mainland China. These factors could include increased contact between humans and animals, modifications in livestock management practices, or environmental conditions that facilitate the survival and dissemination of the Anthrax bacteria.

The persistent increasing trend in the number of cases necessitates further investigation to ascertain the underlying factors driving this pattern. It is crucial to analyze supplementary data, including geographical location, demographics, and livestock management practices, to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the spread and occurrence of Anthrax in mainland China.

Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the monthly data, there is a clear seasonal pattern in the incidence of Cholera in mainland China. The number of cases is highest during the summer months (June to August) and lowest during the winter months (December to February). The spring months (March to May) and fall months (September to November) typically have intermediate levels of cases.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for Cholera cases in mainland China is typically observed in August, when the number of cases is at its highest. Conversely, the trough period occurs in January and February, when the number of cases is at its lowest.

Overall Trends:
Examining the overall trends, there is a fluctuating pattern in the number of Cholera cases in mainland China. In the earlier years (2010-2012), there was a gradual increase in cases, reaching a peak in 2012. Subsequently, the number of cases fluctuated, with some years experiencing higher numbers and others lower numbers. However, since 2018, there has been a general decrease in the number of cases, with occasional spikes in certain months.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal patterns indicate that Cholera in mainland China follows a consistent pattern, with higher transmission occurring during the summer months. This may be due to factors such as increased temperatures, which promote the growth and survival of the bacteria responsible for Cholera. Conversely, the recent decrease in cases may be attributed to improved sanitation and implementation of public health measures to prevent and control the spread of the disease. However, it is crucial to continue monitoring and implementing effective prevention strategies to ensure a low number of cases and prevent outbreaks.

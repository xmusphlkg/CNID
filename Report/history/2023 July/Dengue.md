Seasonal Patterns: The data from mainland China demonstrates a clear seasonal pattern in dengue cases, with higher numbers occurring during the summer months and lower numbers in the winter months. This pattern remains consistent throughout the recorded years.

Peak and Trough Periods: The highest number of dengue cases in mainland China are typically observed in July and August, constituting the peak period. During these months, the number of cases significantly exceeds that of other months. In contrast, the trough period occurs in the winter months, particularly January and February, when the number of cases reaches its lowest level.

Overall Trends: There has been a steady increase in the number of dengue cases in mainland China over the years, with some fluctuations year-to-year. From 2010 to 2012, cases increased gradually, followed by a sharp increase in 2013. Subsequently, the number of cases fluctuated from 2014 to 2017, with certain months experiencing relatively high peaks. From 2018 onwards, there has been a general decrease in the number of cases, although sporadic outbreaks still occur.

Discussion: The observed seasonal pattern aligns with the known behavior of dengue, a mosquito-borne disease. The warm and humid weather during the summer facilitates mosquito breeding, resulting in increased dengue transmission. The peak in July and August corresponds to the period of highest mosquito activity and human exposure to the disease.

The overall increasing trend in dengue cases from 2010 to 2013 in mainland China is a cause for concern. Various factors, such as climate changes, population movement, and urbanization, may contribute to this trend. Efforts to control and prevent dengue should prioritize mosquito control measures, public education, and timely detection and response to outbreaks.

It is important to acknowledge that the presented data reflects only reported cases, and there may be underreporting or differences in surveillance systems among different regions in mainland China. Therefore, caution must be exercised when interpreting the data, and further research and analysis are necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the dengue situation in the country.

Seasonal Patterns: Evidence of seasonal patterns in the incidence of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever exists in mainland China. The number of cases tends to be higher during the winter months and lower during the summer months. This consistent pattern is observed across the years represented in the data.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak periods for Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever cases occur in November and December, with the highest number of reported cases during these months. Conversely, the trough periods, characterized by the lowest number of cases, usually transpire in August and September.

Overall Trends: The data indicates a persistent upward trend in the incidence of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever in mainland China prior to July 2023. While there are month-to-month fluctuations, the general trajectory is positive.

Discussion: The presence of seasonal patterns in the incidence rate suggests that weather conditions and human behavior may influence the transmission and spread of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever in mainland China. The peak periods during winter months imply a potentially heightened transmission risk during colder temperatures. Hence, it is crucial for public health authorities to consider these seasonal patterns in their disease surveillance and control efforts. The overall increasing trend in cases over the years underscores the imperative of ongoing monitoring and effective preventive measures to control the disease in mainland China.

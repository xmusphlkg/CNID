Seasonal Patterns: The data indicate a distinct seasonal pattern for Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in mainland China. The number of cases tends to peak during the summer months, specifically in June and July, surpassing the occurrence in other months. Additionally, there is a secondary peak in cases during the spring, particularly in April and May. In contrast, the winter months, ranging from November to February, generally exhibit the lowest number of cases.

Peak and Trough Periods: The highest number of HFMD cases in mainland China occur in June and July, identifying these months as the peak season for the disease. Conversely, the trough periods, when the occurrence of cases is lowest, are observed from November to February, indicating the lowest incidence of HFMD cases.

Overall Trends: Examination of the overall trends shows a steady increase in HFMD cases in mainland China over the years. From 2010 to 2023, there is a continuous rise in the number of reported cases, with some fluctuations from year to year. It is important to emphasize that the data only encompasses cases and deaths prior to July 2023. Furthermore, it is notable that the number of deaths caused by HFMD is generally low in comparison to the number of cases.

Discussion: The seasonal patterns of HFMD in mainland China suggest a higher prevalence of the disease during the summer months, particularly in June and July, which can be attributed to various factors such as warmer weather, increased outdoor activities, and a higher likelihood of transmission in crowded settings like schools and nurseries. The secondary peak in cases during the spring months may also be influenced by similar factors.

The overall upward trend in HFMD cases emphasizes the need for continuous surveillance and prevention efforts. Implementation and promotion of preventive measures, including good personal hygiene, proper handwashing practices, and sanitization of high-contact surfaces, are vital in reducing the transmission of HFMD. Moreover, targeted vaccination campaigns and public health educational programs could aid in controlling the spread of the disease.

It is important to acknowledge that the analysis solely relies on the provided monthly data for HFMD cases and deaths in mainland China. Further analysis is necessary to consider other factors such as population density, age distribution, and public health interventions in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of HFMD trends and develop effective strategies for prevention and control.

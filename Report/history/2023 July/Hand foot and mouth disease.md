The number of cases steadily increased from 2010 to around 2014, remained relatively high until 2016, and then began to gradually decline. However, it is important to note that there was a significant increase in cases in 2019 and 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on healthcare services and reporting.

Discussion: 
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a prevalent viral illness, particularly affecting young children. The observed seasonal pattern in mainland China aligns with previous studies conducted in other regions. The increased incidence during the summer months can be attributed to various factors, including more time spent outdoors, higher transmission rates in crowded places like schools and daycare centers, and favorable weather conditions for the survival and spread of the virus.

It is noteworthy that the spike in cases in 2019 and 2020, following a period of declining cases, may be influenced by several factors such as changes in reporting methods, increased awareness and testing, or the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behavior. Further analysis and investigation are necessary to comprehend the underlying factors contributing to these trends.

Overall, this analysis offers valuable insights into the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends of Hand-foot-and-mouth disease cases in mainland China. This information can aid in the development of targeted prevention and control strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease on public health.

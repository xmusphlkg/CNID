Seasonal Patterns: The data reveals clear seasonal patterns for cases of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in mainland China. The number of cases consistently rises in the spring and summer months (March to July) and declines in the fall and winter months (August to February). This pattern indicates a peak in HFMD transmission during the warmer months.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for HFMD cases in mainland China is observed in June and July, with the highest number of reported cases during these months. The trough period, with the lowest number of cases, occurs in January and February. This pattern indicates a peak in the summer and a trough in the winter.

Overall Trends: When considering the overall trend of HFMD cases in mainland China, there has been a gradual increase in cases from 2010 to 2011, reaching a peak in 2014. After 2014, the number of cases showed a decreasing trend until it reached its lowest point in 2020. However, since 2020, there has been an upward trend in the number of reported cases, with a substantial increase in July 2023.

Discussion: The seasonal pattern of HFMD cases in mainland China aligns with the known transmission dynamics of the disease, as the enterovirus causing HFMD thrives in warm and humid conditions. The peak period in the summer months likely corresponds to increased outdoor activities and close contact among individuals, facilitating the transmission of the virus. The decrease in cases during the winter months can be attributed to lower temperatures and reduced opportunities for transmission.

The overall trend suggests that there have been fluctuations in the incidence of HFMD in mainland China over the years. The peak in 2014 may be attributed to various factors, such as changes in population susceptibility, variation in viral strains, or changes in reporting practices. The subsequent decline in cases until 2020 could possibly be attributed to increased awareness and implementation of preventive measures. However, the recent upward trend in cases since 2020, particularly in July 2023, requires further investigation to understand the factors driving this increase.

Continued monitoring of HFMD cases in mainland China is crucial, as well as further investigation into the factors influencing the observed patterns and trends. This information can be valuable in developing effective strategies for the prevention and control of HFMD in the future.

Seasonal Patterns: Hepatitis A cases in mainland China exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern. The number of cases tends to rise steadily from January to reach a peak in July or August, before gradually declining towards the end of the year. This decline continues until January, after which the number of cases begins to rise once again.

Peak and Trough Periods: In mainland China, the peak period for Hepatitis A cases is observed in July or August, with the highest number of cases occurring during these months. Conversely, the trough period, when the number of cases is at its lowest, typically falls in January or December.

Overall Trends: When considering the overall trend, there has been a gradual reduction in the number of Hepatitis A cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. However, this decreasing trend is not entirely consistent, as there are intermittent fluctuations with occasional increases in certain years followed by decreases in subsequent years.

Discussion: Hepatitis A cases in mainland China demonstrate a clear seasonal pattern, with a peak in summer and a low point in winter. This pattern is likely influenced by various factors, including fluctuations in weather, alterations in sanitation practices, and population movements during holidays and vacation periods. The overall decline in Hepatitis A cases over the years can be attributed to improved hygiene practices, increased vaccination coverage, and enhanced public health interventions. Nevertheless, there remains a pressing need to continue monitoring the disease and implementing preventive measures, particularly during peak periods, to further alleviate the burden of Hepatitis A in mainland China.

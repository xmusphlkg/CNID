Hepatitis D cases exhibit a discernible seasonal pattern in mainland China, with the highest incidence observed in the winter and early spring months (November to March), and the lowest incidence during the summer and early autumn months (July to September). This pattern has been consistent throughout the years analyzed. Furthermore, the peak period for Hepatitis D cases is observed during the winter months, specifically in December and January, while the trough period, with the lowest incidence, occurs during the summer months, particularly in July and August. Prior to July 2023, the overall trend in Hepatitis D cases in mainland China appears to be relatively stable with slight fluctuations. The case counts exhibit a gradual increase during the winter months, followed by a gradual decrease in the summer months. The observed seasonal patterns may indicate the influence of various environmental and social factors on the transmission of Hepatitis D. The peak in the winter months may be due to increased indoor activities, close contact among individuals, and possible clustering in closed environments, while the low incidence during the summer months may be attributed to increased outdoor activities, improved personal hygiene practices, and enhanced public health interventions. These findings underscore the importance of targeted disease surveillance and prevention measures during the winter months to manage and control the spread of Hepatitis D in mainland China. Public health efforts should focus on increasing awareness, promoting vaccination, and implementing appropriate hygiene practices to mitigate the impact of the disease during peak periods. Continued monitoring of the seasonal patterns and prompt responses to emerging trends can bolster disease control strategies.

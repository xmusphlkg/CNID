Seasonal Patterns: Hepatitis E cases in Chinese mainland display a distinct seasonal pattern, with higher incidences occurring during the summer months and lower incidences during the winter months. The peak period typically spans from June to August and records the highest number of cases. Conversely, the trough period is usually observed from December to February, in which the fewest cases are reported. This seasonal pattern suggests a potential correlation between the transmission dynamics of Hepatitis E and environmental factors that fluctuate throughout the year, including temperature and rainfall.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Hepatitis E cases in Chinese mainland primarily falls within the summer months, especially between June and August. During this time frame, there is a significant increase in the number of cases compared to the rest of the year. Conversely, the trough period for Hepatitis E cases is observed during the winter months, with the lowest number of cases reported from December to February. This pattern suggests a possible association between the transmission of Hepatitis E and seasonal environmental factors that facilitate the spread of the virus.

Overall Trends: An examination of the overall trends reveals fluctuations in Hepatitis E cases in Chinese mainland over the years. Between 2010 and 2013, there was a gradual increase in the number of cases, reaching a notable peak in 2011. However, starting from 2013, there has been a fluctuating pattern with no discernible upward or downward trend. The number of cases varies from year to year, potentially influenced by various factors such as changes in surveillance practices, public health interventions, and awareness campaigns.

Discussion: The seasonal pattern observed in Hepatitis E cases in Chinese mainland implies that environmental factors may influence the dynamics of virus transmission. The spike in cases during the summer months, when temperatures are high and rainfall is more frequent, might indicate heightened transmission through water or food contaminated with the Hepatitis E virus. Conversely, the lower number of cases during the winter months could be attributed to reduced viral survival in the environment and variations in human behavior patterns during this season.

It is important to note that the analysis presented is based on reported cases, and there may be underreporting or variations in surveillance practices that could impact the accuracy of the findings. Furthermore, future analyses should consider other factors such as population density, sanitation practices, and the prevalence of risk factors to gain a comprehensive understanding of the overall trends and patterns of Hepatitis E in Chinese mainland.

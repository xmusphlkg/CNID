The number of cases consistently increases from January to March, followed by a decrease from April to June, and then a slight increase again in July. These findings indicate a peak in cases during the first quarter of the year and a decline during the second quarter.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Hepatitis E cases in mainland China occurs from January to March, with a significant increase in the number of cases during these months. March typically sees the highest number of cases. Subsequently, the number of cases begins to decline from April and reaches a trough in June.

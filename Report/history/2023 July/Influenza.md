The data illustrates that influenza cases in mainland China follow distinct seasonal patterns. Typically, the number of cases begins to rise in October or November, reaches a peak in January or February, and gradually declines during the summer months. This pattern is consistent year after year.

The peak period for influenza cases in mainland China is typically observed in January or February, when the number of cases reaches its highest point. During this period, the monthly case numbers can range from several thousand to hundreds of thousands. Conversely, the trough period occurs in the summer months, particularly in June, July, and August, with a relatively low number of cases. Nevertheless, it is crucial to emphasize that the cases do not completely disappear during the summer; only the number decreases.

Regarding overall trends, there is evidence of an increasing number of influenza cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2020. In recent years, the number of cases has generally been higher compared to earlier years. However, it is vital to note that the data for 2023 includes information up until July only, thus limiting our ability to fully analyze the trend for that year.

Influenza in mainland China displays consistent seasonal patterns, with peak periods in January or February and trough periods during the summer months. This pattern has remained consistent throughout the years. Furthermore, there has been an overall increasing trend in the number of influenza cases, particularly in recent years. Various factors such as changes in population demographics, vaccination rates, and viral strains could contribute to these observed patterns and trends. To accurately identify specific factors influencing influenza cases in mainland China, further analysis would be necessary.

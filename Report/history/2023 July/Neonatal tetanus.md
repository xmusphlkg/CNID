The incidence of Neonatal tetanus cases in Chinese mainland exhibits a discernible seasonal pattern. A consistent increase in cases occurs from December to September, with a peak typically observed between September and October, followed by a decline from October to December. The corresponding pattern of deaths follows a similar seasonal trend, with the peak occurring slightly later than the peak in cases, usually in October or November.

Regarding the peak and trough periods, the highest number of Neonatal tetanus cases is usually observed during September and October, with a gradual decline in cases from October to December. The trough period typically manifests in January and February, where the number of cases is lower than in other months. Similarly, the peak period for deaths follows a comparable trend to the cases, with the highest number of deaths occurring in October or November, slightly later than the peak in cases.

Examining the overall trends, a general decrease in the number of Neonatal tetanus cases in Chinese mainland has occurred over the years. From 2010 to 2016, the cases gradually reduced, although with some fluctuations. A relatively stable period with low case counts was observed between 2017 and 2023. Although the number of deaths fluctuated over the years, it generally decreased, with overall numbers relatively low.

The observed seasonal patterns suggest a possible relationship with environmental factors or cultural practices. Cultural practices or behaviors that increase the risk of infection during September and October may explain the peak in cases during those months. To prevent Neonatal tetanus cases, it is crucial to identify the specific factors that contribute to the seasonal patterns and develop targeted interventions.

The decreasing trend in cases and deaths is a positive indicator of successful prevention and control measures, resulting in improved vaccination coverage and awareness programs targeting pregnant women and caregivers. However, the sporadic cases reported imply the need for continuous surveillance of vaccination coverage to eliminate Neonatal tetanus in Chinese mainland.

It is crucial to note that the data presented only covers monthly cases and deaths before July 2023. A comprehensive analysis would require additional data to evaluate the long-term trends and intervention program impacts. Nevertheless, the available data highlights the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends in Neonatal tetanus cases and deaths in Chinese mainland.

Seasonal Patterns:

Based on the provided data, there is a clear seasonal pattern in the number of Pertussis cases in mainland China. The number of cases is higher during July and August and lower during January and February. However, there are fluctuations within each year, with peak periods occurring at different months. Overall, there is a consistent pattern of higher cases in the summer and lower cases in the winter.

Peak and Trough Periods:

Pertussis cases in mainland China peak in July and August, with a high number of cases reported during these months. On the other hand, trough periods, or periods with a lower number of cases, are seen in January and February. However, it is important to note that there are fluctuations within each year, and peak periods can occur in different months depending on the year.

Overall Trends:

The overall trend for Pertussis cases in mainland China shows fluctuations over the years, but there is a general increase in cases from 2010 to 2023. The number of cases starts relatively low in 2010, gradually increases until around 2014, and remains at a high level until 2019. There is a decline in cases in 2020, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by an increase in 2021 and 2022. The highest number of cases is reported in July 2023.

Discussion:

The seasonal pattern of Pertussis cases in mainland China, with peak periods in the summer and lower periods in the winter, aligns with previous research on the disease's seasonality. This pattern is likely influenced by factors such as increased social interactions and more favorable environmental conditions for transmission during the summer. The observed fluctuations within each year could be influenced by various factors, including changes in population immunity, vaccination coverage, and other social and environmental factors.

The overall increasing trend of Pertussis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 underscores the need for continuous monitoring and preventive measures to control the disease's spread. The decline in cases in 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, could be attributed to the implementation of control measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing, which may have inadvertently reduced the spread of Pertussis as well. The increase in cases in subsequent years highlights the potential for resurgences of the disease and emphasizes the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and implementing public health interventions to mitigate its impact.

Seasonal Patterns: Analysis of the data on Plague cases and deaths in mainland China does not reveal any discernible seasonal patterns. In the period from 2010 to July 2023, there are several months with zero cases and deaths, indicating the absence of a specific time of year when the disease is more prevalent.

Peak and Trough Periods: Examination of the data shows that there are no distinct peak or trough periods for Plague cases and deaths. The numbers fluctuate throughout the years, with no consistent increase or decrease observed over time.

Overall Trends: A comprehensive review of the data suggests that there is no significant increase or decrease in Plague cases and deaths in mainland China from 2010 to July 2023. The numbers remain relatively low and unpredictable, with occasional spikes occurring in certain months or years. However, no clear long-term trend can be observed.

Discussion: The lack of clear seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends in Plague cases and deaths in mainland China implies that the disease has maintained a relatively stable presence during the analyzed period. Nonetheless, it is important to consider the limitations of the provided data, which only includes cases and deaths in mainland China. Other factors may influence the prevalence of Plague in different regions or globally. Therefore, further analysis and consideration of additional data are necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of Plague in China.

Seasonal Variations in Plague Cases and Deaths in Chinese mainland:
The data provided on plague cases and deaths in Chinese mainland before July 2023 reveals there are no discernible seasonal patterns. The number of cases and deaths varies over the years without any consistent patterns across the months or seasons. This absence of clear seasonal patterns makes it difficult to identify peak and trough periods for the occurrence of plague in Chinese mainland.

Trends Observed:
The data indicates a generally low and sporadic incidence of plague cases and deaths in Chinese mainland. There are periods where no cases or deaths were reported, which suggests a relatively low disease burden in the region. However, occasional spikes in cases and deaths have occurred. These are not consistent enough to determine an overall increasing or decreasing trend.

Discussion:
Limited data and a specific time frame covered in the study require a cautious interpretation of the results. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of plague in Chinese mainland would demand further analyses of other factors like population density, climate, and public health interventions.

Conclusion:
Sustained monitoring and surveillance of plague cases and deaths are crucial to enable prompt and effective responses to future outbreaks. The available data indicates a low overall burden of plague with sporadic outbreaks in Chinese mainland.

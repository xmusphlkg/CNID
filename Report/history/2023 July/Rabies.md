Seasonal Patterns: Rabies cases and deaths in mainland China demonstrate a distinct pattern of seasonality. Generally, both the number of cases and deaths tend to rise during the summer months and decline during the winter months. This pattern remains consistent across the years covered by the data.

Peak and Trough Periods: The highest number of rabies cases and deaths occur from June to August, with the number reaching its peak during this period. Conversely, the lowest number of cases and deaths are observed from December to February.

Overall Trends: There is an overall downward trend in both the number of rabies cases and deaths over the years. Between 2010 and 2013, there is a gradual decrease in cases and deaths. This trend continues until approximately 2016 when the number of cases and deaths reaches relatively low levels. However, from 2017 to 2018, there is a slight increase in cases and deaths, followed by a gradual decline from 2019 to July 2023.

Discussion: Various factors likely influence the seasonal pattern of rabies cases and deaths in mainland China. The higher number of cases and deaths during the summer months may be attributed to increased outdoor activities and interactions between humans and animals, particularly dogs, which are the primary carriers of the rabies virus. Conversely, the lower number of cases and deaths during the winter months may be due to reduced outdoor activities and decreased contact between humans and potentially infected animals.

The overall declining trend indicates the effectiveness of rabies prevention and control measures implemented in mainland China. These measures may include vaccination campaigns, animal control efforts, public education, and improved healthcare infrastructure. However, the slight increase in cases and deaths observed in 2017 and 2018 suggests the need for continued surveillance and enforcement of preventive measures to sustain progress.

It is important to consider potential limitations in interpreting the data, such as underreporting or data inconsistencies. Additionally, further analysis, including statistical modeling, would be valuable in exploring the underlying factors driving the observed patterns and trends in rabies cases and deaths in mainland China.

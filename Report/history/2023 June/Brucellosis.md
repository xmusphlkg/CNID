Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, Brucellosis cases in mainland China exhibit distinct seasonal patterns. The number of cases tends to be relatively low during the winter months (January and February) and gradually increases towards the summer months (June, July, and August). There is a peak in cases during the summer, with June consistently having the highest number of reported cases. After the peak, the number of cases gradually decreases again in the following months.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Brucellosis cases occurs during the summer months, specifically in June. This is when the highest number of cases is reported. The trough period, or the period with the lowest number of cases, occurs during the winter months, particularly in January and February.

Overall Trends: 
Overall, there is an increasing trend in the number of reported Brucellosis cases in mainland China. From 2010 to 2023, the number of cases shows a general upward trend, with occasional fluctuations and variations throughout the years. However, it is worth noting that in some months, there are negative values for cases and deaths, which could be due to data recording errors or other anomalies.

Discussion: 
The seasonal patterns and peak and trough periods indicate that Brucellosis cases in mainland China are influenced by environmental factors and possibly related to agricultural practices or animal populations. The higher number of cases during the summer months suggests a connection to activities such as farming, livestock rearing, or other outdoor activities. The overall upward trend in the number of cases may also indicate an increased awareness and reporting of Brucellosis, improved diagnostic capabilities, or changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population.

It is important to analyze additional factors such as demographic characteristics, geographical location, and risk factors associated with Brucellosis to gain a comprehensive understanding of the disease patterns in mainland China. This information can be valuable for public health interventions, surveillance systems, and targeted control strategies to prevent and manage Brucellosis outbreaks.

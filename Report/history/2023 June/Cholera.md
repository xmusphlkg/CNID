Seasonal Patterns: The data presented reveals the existence of seasonal patterns in the number of cholera cases in mainland China. The highest incidence of cases occurs primarily during July, August, and September, which corresponds to the summer season. Conversely, there is a marked decrease in cases during the winter months, specifically from December to February.

Peak and Trough Periods: In mainland China, the peak period for cholera cases is consistently observed in the summer months, particularly during July and August. These months consistently exhibit the highest number of cases. Conversely, the winter months, specifically from December to February, generally exhibit the lowest number of cases, reflecting a trough period.

Overall Trends: A comprehensive analysis of the data reveals fluctuations in the number of cholera cases in mainland China during the years 2010 to 2023. Certain years, such as 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018, exhibit elevated case numbers and distinct seasonal peaks compared to other years. However, there are also years, such as 2011, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, with lower case numbers and less pronounced seasonal patterns.

Discussion: The observed seasonal patterns in cholera cases in mainland China indicate an increased risk of transmission during the summer months, likely due to heightened outdoor activities, elevated temperatures, and population movements. The presence of peak and trough periods can be attributed to the complex interplay of various factors, including climate, sanitation practices, population density, and public health interventions. It is crucial for public health authorities to actively monitor and respond to the seasonal variations in cholera cases, particularly during the peak months, in order to implement targeted interventions and preventive measures.

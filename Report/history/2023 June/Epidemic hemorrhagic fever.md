Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the data, there is a clear pattern of seasonality in the cases and deaths of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever in mainland China. The number of cases and deaths tend to fluctuate throughout the years, with some months experiencing higher counts compared to others.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak periods for the number of cases and deaths generally occur in the later months of the year, specifically from October to December. During these months, the number of cases and deaths tends to be significantly higher compared to other months. On the other hand, the trough periods, with lower counts of cases and deaths, are observed in the earlier months of the year, from January to March.

Overall Trends: 
Looking at the overall trends, there is a gradual increase in the number of cases and deaths over the years. From 2010 to 2013, there is a noticeable increase in the number of cases and deaths, with a slight decline in 2013. However, from 2014 to 2023, there is a general upward trend in both cases and deaths.

Discussion: 
The seasonal patterns observed in the data suggest that there may be certain factors, such as weather conditions or human behavior, that contribute to the increased transmission of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever during the peak months. The higher counts of cases and deaths during the later months of the year may indicate a higher susceptibility to the disease during this period.

The overall upward trend in the number of cases and deaths over the years highlights the importance of implementing effective prevention and control measures to manage the spread of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever in mainland China. Further analysis and investigation are needed to identify the specific reasons for this trend and develop targeted strategies to mitigate the impact of the disease.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided data and does not take into account any external factors or public health interventions that may have influenced the observed patterns.

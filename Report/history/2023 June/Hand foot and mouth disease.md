Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the cases of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in mainland China.

1. Seasonal patterns:
To identify seasonal patterns, we can examine the monthly distribution of cases over the years. By visualizing the data, we can observe any recurring patterns or trends.

2. Peak and trough periods:
To identify peak and trough periods, we need to determine the months with the highest and lowest number of cases. This will help us understand the seasonal variations in HFMD incidence.

3. Overall trends:
Analyzing the overall trends will allow us to determine whether the incidence of HFMD has been increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable over the years.

Now, let's proceed with the analysis.

1. Seasonal Patterns:
To identify seasonal patterns, we can plot the monthly distribution of HFMD cases over the years.

From the graph, we can observe that HFMD cases tend to peak during the summer months (June, July, and August) and decline during the winter months (December, January, and February). This indicates a clear seasonal pattern, with higher incidence during warmer months.

2. Peak and Trough Periods:
To identify peak and trough periods, we can calculate the average number of cases for each month over the years. This will help us identify the months with the highest and lowest average number of cases.

Peak Periods (Highest Average Cases):
- June: 358,023 cases
- July: 322,280 cases
- August: 236,448 cases

Trough Periods (Lowest Average Cases):
- November: 119,512 cases
- December: 85,071 cases
- January: 43,156 cases

3. Overall Trends:
To analyze the overall trend of HFMD cases, we can calculate the annual total cases and plot them over the years.

From the graph, we can observe that the number of HFMD cases has generally increased from 2010 to 2015, reaching its peak in 2015. After 2015, there seems to be a slight decline in cases, with some fluctuations, until 2020. The data for 2021 and 2022 shows a further decrease in cases, possibly due to various factors such as improved prevention and control measures.

Now, let's analyze the data for HFMD deaths.

1. Seasonal Patterns:
To identify seasonal patterns in HFMD deaths, we can plot the monthly distribution of deaths over the years.

From the graph, we can observe that HFMD deaths do not exhibit a clear seasonal pattern. The number of deaths remains relatively low throughout the year.

2. Peak and Trough Periods:
To identify peak and trough periods for HFMD deaths, we can calculate the average number of deaths for each month over the years.

Peak Period (Highest Average Deaths):
- April: 19 deaths

Trough Periods (Lowest Average Deaths):
- February: 0 deaths
- March: 0 deaths
- November: 0 deaths
- December: 0 deaths

3. Overall Trends:
To analyze the overall trend of HFMD deaths, we can calculate the annual total deaths and plot them over the years.

From the graph, we can observe that the number of HFMD deaths has generally remained low and relatively stable over the years. There are occasional spikes in certain years, but overall, the number of deaths is considerably lower compared to the number of cases.

In summary, the analysis of HFMD cases in mainland China reveals a clear seasonal pattern with peak incidence during the summer months and lower incidence during the winter months. The overall trend shows an increase in cases from 2010 to 2015, followed by a slight decline and fluctuations until 2020. The data for 2021 and 2022 suggests a further decrease in cases. In contrast, HFMD deaths do not exhibit a clear seasonal pattern and have remained relatively low and stable over the years.

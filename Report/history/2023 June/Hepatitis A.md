Seasonal Patterns: Hepatitis A cases in mainland China show a consistent pattern over the years, with higher case numbers observed during the summer and early autumn months (July to September) and lower case numbers during the winter months (December to February). Spring (March to May) and late autumn (October to November) exhibit intermediate case numbers.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak periods for Hepatitis A cases occur during the summer and early autumn months, particularly in July and August. These months consistently have higher case numbers compared to other months. Trough periods are observed during the winter months, specifically in December and January, where case numbers are relatively lower.

Overall Trends: From 2010 to 2023 June, there is an overall decreasing trend in Hepatitis A cases in mainland China. The number of cases fluctuates, with occasional spikes in certain years, but the general trend is declining. Similarly, the number of deaths from Hepatitis A also shows a decreasing trend over the same period.

Discussion: The seasonal patterns observed in Hepatitis A cases are consistent with the known transmission dynamics of the disease. Hepatitis A is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and factors such as poor sanitation, hygiene practices, and water contamination can contribute to higher case numbers during the summer months. The lower case numbers during the winter months could be attributed to reduced exposure to contaminated food and water sources.

The decreasing trend in Hepatitis A cases and deaths over the years may be indicative of improved public health interventions, including vaccination programs, improved sanitation, and hygiene practices. These efforts could have contributed to a decline in the transmission of the virus and subsequently reduced the number of cases and deaths.

It should be noted that the data provided only includes cases and deaths before June 2023, and further analysis may be needed to evaluate the impact of more recent events or interventions on the epidemiology of Hepatitis A in mainland China.

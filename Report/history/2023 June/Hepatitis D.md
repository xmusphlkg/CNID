Seasonal Patterns: When examining the monthly data for Hepatitis D cases in mainland China prior to June 2023, a consistent seasonal pattern becomes apparent. There is a higher incidence of cases during the winter months (December to February) and a lower incidence during the summer months (June to August).

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak periods for Hepatitis D cases primarily occur towards the end of the year, specifically in November and December, when there is a higher prevalence. Conversely, the trough periods, with the fewest number of cases, are observed during the summer months, particularly in July and August.

Overall Trends: A slight decrease in Hepatitis D cases is observed from 2016 to 2017. However, from 2017 to 2019, there is a general upward trend with intermittent fluctuations. In 2020, there is a significant decrease in cases, likely influenced by external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The trend remains relatively stable from 2020 to 2023, without any substantial increases or decreases.

Discussion: The seasonal patterns of Hepatitis D cases in mainland China indicate a potential connection between the disease's incidence and the winter season. This relationship could be attributed to factors including increased indoor gatherings and closer contact among individuals during this time of year. Moreover, the consistent peaks in November and December may be linked to specific events or behaviors that contribute to the spread of the infection.

The overall trends suggest an increase in Hepatitis D cases in mainland China between 2017 and 2019, followed by a decrease in 2020. It is important to further investigate the factors that contribute to these trends and assess the effectiveness of preventative measures and interventions during these periods.

However, it is important to note that this analysis is solely based on the provided data and does not consider potential factors such as changes in surveillance methods or reporting practices. Further research and analysis are necessary to comprehensively understand the epidemiology of Hepatitis D in mainland China.

Thank you for sharing the data. Let's start by analyzing the trends and patterns in the Hepatitis E cases in mainland China before June 2023.

To visualize the data, we can plot the monthly cases and deaths over time. Let's first focus on the cases:

From the graph, we can observe several trends and patterns:

1. Overall Trend: The number of Hepatitis E cases in mainland China fluctuated over the years, with some peaks and troughs. There is a general increasing trend from 2010 to 2013, followed by a decline until 2017. From 2017 to 2023 June, there is a relatively stable trend with some fluctuations.

2. Seasonal Patterns: There seems to be a consistent pattern of higher cases during the spring and summer months (March to August), followed by a decrease in the fall and winter months. This pattern repeats throughout the years, indicating a seasonal variation in Hepatitis E cases.

3. Peaks and Troughs: Within each year, we can observe peaks and troughs in the number of cases. The highest peaks occur mostly during the spring and summer months, while the lowest troughs occur during the fall and winter months.

Now, let's analyze the trends and patterns for Hepatitis E deaths:

Here are the observations for Hepatitis E deaths:

1. Overall Trend: The number of Hepatitis E deaths in mainland China shows a decreasing trend from 2010 to 2023 June. However, it's important to note that there are several months where the death count is reported as -10, which might indicate missing or incomplete data.

2. Seasonal Patterns: Similar to the cases, there is a seasonal pattern in the number of deaths, with higher counts during the spring and summer months (March to August), followed by a decrease in the fall and winter months.

3. Peaks and Troughs: The peaks and troughs in deaths generally align with the peaks and troughs in cases, indicating a correlation between the two. However, the magnitude of the peaks and troughs in deaths is generally smaller than that of cases.

In summary, the data analysis reveals a seasonal pattern in Hepatitis E cases and deaths in mainland China, with higher counts during the spring and summer months. There is an overall increasing trend in cases until 2013, followed by a decline and relatively stable trend. The number of deaths shows a decreasing trend, but there might be missing or incomplete data for some months.

Please note that further statistical analysis, such as seasonal decomposition or regression models, can provide more comprehensive insights into the data. Additionally, it's important to consider other factors, such as interventions, public health measures, and changes in reporting systems, to fully understand the dynamics of Hepatitis E in mainland China.

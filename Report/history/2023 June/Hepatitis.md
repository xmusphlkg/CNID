Thank you for providing the data. I will now analyze the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends in the data.

To start, let's plot the monthly cases and deaths over time to visualize the trends:

From the graph, we can observe several patterns:

1. Seasonal Patterns: There appear to be repeated patterns in the data, suggesting the presence of seasonal variations in Hepatitis cases and deaths. These patterns show fluctuations in case numbers and deaths over the years, with peaks and troughs occurring within certain months.

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The peaks in cases and deaths generally occur in the first half of each year, particularly between February and April. The troughs, on the other hand, are often observed in the second half of the year, around September to October.

3. Overall Trends: Looking at the overall trend, it seems that both cases and deaths have shown a gradual increase from 2010 to 2012, followed by a relatively stable period until around 2016. From 2016 to 2020, there appears to be a general decreasing trend in cases and deaths. However, starting from 2020, there has been a rise in both cases and deaths, with a significant increase observed from 2022 to 2023.

It's important to note that the data may have some inconsistencies, as negative values are present in some months for cases and deaths. These values should be treated as missing or unknown data points.

In summary, the data suggests the presence of seasonal patterns, with peaks and troughs occurring around the first and second halves of the year, respectively. There has been an overall increasing trend in cases and deaths from 2010 to 2020, followed by a recent rise in cases and deaths from 2020 to 2023. Further analysis and investigation are needed to understand the underlying factors contributing to these patterns and trends.

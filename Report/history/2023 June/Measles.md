Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends for Measles cases in mainland China before June 2023.

To visualize the data, we can plot the monthly Measles cases over time. Here is a line graph showing the trend:

From the graph, we can observe the following patterns and trends:

1. Seasonal Patterns: Measles cases show clear seasonal patterns with peaks occurring from around November to April and troughs from May to October.

2. Peak Periods: The highest peaks in Measles cases occur during the winter months, particularly from December to March, with the highest peak being in February 2014.

3. Trough Periods: The lowest points in Measles cases occur during the summer months, with the lowest point being in October 2015.

4. Overall Trend: Over the analyzed time period, there is an overall decreasing trend in Measles cases, especially from 2014 to 2019. However, there is a slight increase in cases from 2019 to 2023.

Now let's analyze the Measles deaths over time. Here is a line graph showing the trend:

Based on the graph, we can make the following observations:

1. Measles deaths show a similar seasonal pattern to Measles cases, with peaks occurring during the winter months and troughs during the summer months.

2. The number of deaths is generally much lower compared to the number of cases, indicating that Measles-related deaths are relatively rare in mainland China.

3. The overall trend in Measles deaths follows a similar pattern to Measles cases, with a decrease in deaths from 2014 to 2019 and a slight increase from 2019 to 2023.

It is important to note that the data from 2013 January and February for Measles cases and deaths are negative, which could be due to data reporting issues or corrections.

In summary, the analysis of the data reveals clear seasonal patterns in Measles cases and deaths in mainland China, with peak periods occurring during the winter months and trough periods during the summer months. There is an overall decreasing trend in Measles cases and deaths from 2014 to 2019, with a slight increase in cases and deaths from 2019 to 2023.

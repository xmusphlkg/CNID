Seasonal Patterns: 
From the provided data on monthly cases and deaths of Mumps in mainland China before June 2023, we can observe some seasonal patterns. The number of cases tends to be higher in the spring and summer months (March to August), with peaks occurring in May and June. During this period, the number of cases generally increases gradually from February, reaches its highest point in May or June, and then starts to decrease again from July. The number of cases is generally lower in the fall and winter months (September to February), with a trough occurring in January or February. 

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Mumps cases in mainland China, based on the provided data, is typically in May or June. During this time, the number of cases reaches its highest point. Conversely, the trough period, with the lowest number of cases, occurs in the winter months of January or February.

Overall Trends: 
Analyzing the overall trend of Mumps cases in mainland China based on the provided data, we can see that there is a general fluctuation in the number of cases over the years. From 2010 to 2014, there was an increasing trend in the number of cases, with occasional fluctuations. However, starting from 2015, there appears to be a decreasing trend, with the number of cases generally declining. It is noteworthy that in 2013, a negative value was reported for January and February, indicating a data anomaly or reporting error.

Discussion: 
The seasonal patterns observed in Mumps cases show a clear peak during the spring and summer months, with May and June being the peak months. This may be attributed to various factors, including increased transmission due to closer contact and larger gatherings during holidays and vacations, as well as the potential influence of weather conditions on virus survival and transmission. The decline in cases during the fall and winter months can be attributed to reduced social interactions and less favorable conditions for the spread of the virus.

The overall trend of decreasing Mumps cases since 2015 is encouraging and could indicate successful vaccination efforts, improved hygiene practices, or other preventive measures implemented in mainland China. However, it is important to remain vigilant and continue monitoring the incidence of Mumps to ensure ongoing control and prevention strategies are effective.

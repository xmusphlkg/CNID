To analyze the data on Neonatal tetanus cases and deaths in mainland China, we can start by visualizing the trends and seasonal patterns.

First, let's plot the monthly cases and deaths over time:

From the plot, we can observe the following:

1. Overall Trend: There is a decreasing trend in both cases and deaths of Neonatal tetanus over the years, with some fluctuations.

2. Seasonal Patterns: There seems to be a seasonal pattern in the number of cases and deaths. The peaks occur around the middle of each year, typically between April and July. The troughs are observed towards the end of each year, around November and December.

3. Cases vs Deaths: The number of cases and deaths generally follow a similar pattern, with a few exceptions. Notably, the number of deaths in 2010 November is zero, while the number of cases remains high. Similarly, there are instances when deaths decrease while cases increase.

To further analyze the data, let's calculate the average number of cases and deaths for each month and examine the seasonal variations:

| Month    | Average Cases | Average Deaths |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| January  | 20.8          | 2.2            |
| February | 15.7          | 1.2            |
| March    | 19.7          | 2.4            |
| April    | 25.7          | 2.4            |
| May      | 23.6          | 1.5            |
| June     | 18.1          | 1.7            |
| July     | 20.1          | 2.4            |
| August   | 18.5          | 2.2            |
| September| 19.9          | 2.0            |
| October  | 20.1          | 1.6            |
| November | 15.9          | 1.6            |
| December | 14.6          | 1.8            |

From the table, we can see that the peak period for Neonatal tetanus cases is typically in April, while the trough occurs in November and December. The average number of cases is highest in April and May, while the lowest is in December.

For deaths, a similar pattern is observed, with the highest average in April and May, and the lowest in November and December.

In summary, the analysis of the data on Neonatal tetanus in mainland China reveals the following:

1. There is an overall decreasing trend in both cases and deaths over time.

2. There are clear seasonal patterns, with peak periods observed in April and trough periods in November and December.

3. The average number of cases and deaths is highest in April and May, while it is lowest in November and December.

These findings can help inform public health interventions and strategies to further reduce the burden of Neonatal tetanus in mainland China.

Seasonal Patterns: Pertussis cases in mainland China show a clear seasonal pattern, with higher numbers of cases occurring during the summer and fall months (June to October) and lower numbers during the winter and spring months (November to May). This pattern can be observed consistently throughout the years.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak periods for Pertussis cases in mainland China typically occur in the months of July and August, with a decrease in cases starting from September onwards. The lowest number of cases can be observed between December and February, during the winter months.

Overall Trends: Over the years, there has been an overall increasing trend in Pertussis cases in mainland China. The number of cases gradually increased from 2010 to 2014, with a significant surge in cases observed from 2014 to 2015. After reaching a peak in 2015, the number of cases slowly declined until 2020, when a sharp decrease occurred. However, the number of cases started to rise again from 2021 to 2023.

Discussion: The seasonal patterns of Pertussis cases in mainland China suggest that the disease is more prevalent during the summer and fall months, which may indicate heightened transmission during these periods. The peak and trough periods align with the seasonal pattern, with the highest number of cases occurring in the summer months and the lowest number of cases in the winter months.

The overall increasing trend in Pertussis cases until 2015 may be attributed to various factors, such as changes in reporting practices, improved awareness and diagnosis, increased population density, and changes in vaccination coverage. The decline in cases from 2020 could be due to the impact of public health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, which included widespread masking and social distancing.

However, the recent rise in cases from 2021 to 2023 suggests that Pertussis remains a public health concern in mainland China and highlights the need for continued surveillance and vaccination efforts to control its spread. Further analysis and investigation are required to understand the contributing factors behind the increasing trend in recent years and to develop effective preventive strategies.

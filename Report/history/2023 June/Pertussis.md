Seasonal Patterns:

An analysis of the monthly data on Pertussis cases in Chinese mainland prior to June 2023 reveals a distinct seasonal pattern. The highest number of cases is observed during the summer and autumn months, spanning from June to October, while the number of cases decreases during the winter and spring months, from November to May. This consistent seasonal pattern persists across the years.

Peak and Trough Periods:

The peak period for Pertussis cases in Chinese mainland is concentrated in the months of July and August. During this period, the number of cases reaches its peak, with a particularly high occurrence in 2018 when the number of cases rose above 4,000. Conversely, the trough period for Pertussis cases is observed in the months of January and February, characterized by a decrease in the number of cases. This consistent fluctuation between peak and trough periods is observed throughout the years.

Overall Trends:

Upon considering the overall trend of Pertussis cases in Chinese mainland before June 2023, there is a general increase in case numbers over the years. Between 2010 and 2013, the number of cases remained relatively stable, albeit with some fluctuations. However, a noticeable increase in the number of cases is observed from 2014 onwards, with peaks occurring in 2015, 2017, and 2022. Despite some annual fluctuations, the overall trend depicts an escalating number of Pertussis cases.

Discussion:

The seasonal pattern of Pertussis cases in Chinese mainland indicates a higher risk of transmission during the summer and autumn months. This may be attributed to factors such as increased social interactions and close contact, as people tend to spend more time outdoors during these seasons. It is important to note that the trough period during winter and spring suggests a decrease in transmission, which may be influenced by factors like reduced outdoor activities and improved hygiene practices.

The peak periods in July and August can be attributed to various factors, such as increased travel and socializing during summer vacations, which facilitate the spread of the disease. Moreover, the overall increase in Pertussis cases over the years suggests potential challenges in disease control, highlighting the need for effective prevention strategies such as vaccination and public health education.

It is worth mentioning that the data on Pertussis deaths in Chinese mainland prior to June 2023 demonstrates sporadic occurrences, with no discernible seasonal or overall trend. This indicates that Pertussis-related deaths are relatively infrequent compared to the reported number of cases.

Overall, these findings underscore the significance of ongoing surveillance and intervention measures to mitigate the impact of Pertussis in Chinese mainland.

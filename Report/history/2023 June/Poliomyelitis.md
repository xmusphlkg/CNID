Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends for Poliomyelitis cases and deaths in mainland China.

First, let's focus on the cases. Looking at the data, we can see that there have been no reported cases of Poliomyelitis in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 June. This indicates a consistent absence of Poliomyelitis cases during this period.

Next, let's analyze the deaths due to Poliomyelitis. Similar to the cases, there have been no reported deaths due to Poliomyelitis in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 June. This confirms that there have been no fatalities associated with Poliomyelitis during this period as well.

Based on the available data, we can conclude that there is no evidence of seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, or overall trends for Poliomyelitis cases and deaths in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 June. It is important to note that the absence of reported cases and deaths does not necessarily mean that Poliomyelitis is completely eradicated in mainland China, as there could be various factors contributing to underreporting or lack of data.

Please let me know if there is anything specific you would like to further analyze or any additional information you need for your paper.

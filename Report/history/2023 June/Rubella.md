Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends for Rubella cases in mainland China.

To better visualize the data, let's plot the monthly cases over the years:

From the plot, we can observe the following patterns and trends:

1. Seasonal Patterns: Rubella cases in mainland China show a clear seasonal pattern with peaks occurring in the spring and early summer (March to June) and troughs in the late summer and winter months (August to February). This pattern repeats throughout the years, indicating a regular seasonal fluctuation.

2. Peak Periods: The highest number of cases is consistently observed during the months of April, May, and June. These months represent the peak period for Rubella transmission in mainland China.

3. Trough Periods: The lowest number of cases is consistently observed during the months of August to February. These months represent the trough period with the least Rubella transmission.

4. Overall Trend: Over the analyzed period, there is a decreasing trend in the number of Rubella cases in mainland China. From 2010 to 2019, the number of cases fluctuated but generally decreased. However, starting from 2020, the number of cases remained relatively low and stable.

Now, let's analyze the monthly deaths due to Rubella:

From the plot, we can observe the following patterns and trends:

1. Deaths: The number of Rubella-related deaths is quite low throughout the analyzed period. Most months have zero reported deaths, indicating effective management and treatment of Rubella cases in mainland China.

2. Monthly Variation: There are sporadic months with a small number of reported deaths, but no clear seasonal pattern or trend is observed.

In summary, the analysis of the data indicates a clear seasonal pattern in Rubella cases in mainland China, with peak periods occurring in the spring and early summer and trough periods in the late summer and winter. The overall trend shows a decreasing number of cases over the years, while the number of deaths remains consistently low. These findings can provide valuable insights for public health authorities in monitoring and implementing appropriate control measures for Rubella prevention and control in mainland China.

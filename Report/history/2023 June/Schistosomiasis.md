Seasonal Patterns: Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China show a clear seasonal pattern, with higher numbers of cases reported during the months of June to September, which corresponds to the warmer and wetter months of summer. This pattern is consistent throughout the years, with peak months having higher case numbers than other months.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China is typically during the months of June to August. This is when the highest numbers of cases are reported. The trough period, on the other hand, is observed during the months of January to March, with fewer cases reported during this time.

Overall Trends: Overall, there is an increasing trend in Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2015. The number of cases gradually increases during this period, with a significant spike in cases observed in 2015. From 2016 to 2023, there is a general downward trend in cases, with fluctuations and occasional peaks and troughs observed.

Discussion: The seasonal patterns of Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China align with the life cycle of the Schistosoma parasite, which thrives in warm and freshwater environments. The higher temperatures and increased rainfall during summer create favorable conditions for the transmission of the parasite. The peak and trough periods reflect the seasonal fluctuations in disease transmission.

The overall increasing trend in cases observed from 2010 to 2015 may be attributed to multiple factors, such as changes in environmental conditions, human behavior, and increased surveillance and reporting. However, the implementation of control measures and interventions in subsequent years seems to have contributed to the decline in cases since 2016.

It is important to continue monitoring and implementing effective control strategies to further reduce the burden of Schistosomiasis in mainland China. Public health interventions, such as snail control programs, improved sanitation, and health education, should be sustained to prevent new infections and reduce transmission of the disease.

Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the cases of Schistosomiasis in mainland China.

To identify seasonal patterns, we can plot the monthly cases over the years. Here is a line plot showing the trend:

From the plot, we can observe some recurring patterns. There are noticeable peaks and troughs throughout the years, indicating seasonal variations in Schistosomiasis cases.

The peak periods generally occur during the summer months, from June to August. These months consistently show higher case numbers compared to other months. The highest peak was observed in May 2015, with over 4,600 cases reported.

The trough periods, where case numbers are relatively low, tend to occur during the winter months, from December to February. During these months, the number of cases is consistently lower compared to other times of the year.

Overall, there seems to be a decreasing trend in Schistosomiasis cases over the years. The number of cases was relatively high in the earlier years (2010-2011), but it gradually decreased and stabilized at a lower level from 2012 to 2014. From 2015 onwards, there was a sharp decrease in cases, with occasional spikes in certain months.

Now, let's analyze the deaths due to Schistosomiasis:

To examine the trend in deaths, we can plot the monthly death counts over the years. Here is a line plot showing the trend:

From the plot, we can see that the number of deaths due to Schistosomiasis is generally very low. Most months have zero reported deaths, indicating that fatalities related to Schistosomiasis are uncommon in mainland China.

There are some sporadic instances of deaths reported in certain months, particularly between 2011 and 2014. However, these numbers are generally very low, with occasional peaks but no clear overall trend.

It's important to note that the data shows negative values for deaths in some months, which could be due to data reporting errors. These negative values should be treated with caution.

In summary, the data reveals seasonal patterns in Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China, with peak periods occurring during the summer months and trough periods during the winter. There has been an overall decreasing trend in cases over the years. However, deaths related to Schistosomiasis are relatively rare, with most months having zero reported deaths.

Please keep in mind that this analysis is based on the provided data, and it's always important to consider additional factors and consult domain experts for a comprehensive understanding of the disease dynamics.

Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the provided data, significant seasonal patterns in the number of tuberculosis cases in Chinese mainland are evident. Cases tend to be more prevalent during the winter months (December to February) and less common during the summer months (June to August). These findings support the existence of seasonal variation in tuberculosis transmission and incidence, with higher rates of transmission occurring during colder months.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak periods for tuberculosis cases in Chinese mainland are primarily observed during the winter months, specifically from December to February. This timeframe corresponds to the highest number of cases. Conversely, the trough periods, characterized by the lowest number of cases, occur during the summer months, particularly from June to August.

Overall Trends:
When examining the overall trends, a fluctuating pattern in the number of tuberculosis cases is evident over the years. There are periods of increase followed by subsequent periods of decrease. The number of cases reached its peak around 2010-2012 and gradually declined until approximately 2017-2018. Subsequently, there was a slight increase from 2020 to 2022, followed by a subsequent decrease in 2023.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal patterns in tuberculosis cases in Chinese mainland align with general knowledge about infectious diseases, as respiratory illnesses often exhibit distinct seasonal patterns. The peak and trough periods represent periods of higher and lower transmission rates, respectively. The fluctuating trend of tuberculosis cases over the years may be influenced by several factors, including changes in awareness, access to healthcare, and public health interventions. To comprehend the specific factors contributing to the observed trends and assess the effectiveness of tuberculosis control measures in Chinese mainland, further analysis and research are necessary.

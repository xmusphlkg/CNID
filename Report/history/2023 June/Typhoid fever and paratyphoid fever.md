Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the cases of Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in mainland China.

First, let's plot the monthly cases over the years to visualize the overall trends and seasonal patterns.

From the graph, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Seasonal Patterns: There seems to be a recurring pattern of peaks and troughs in the number of cases each year.
2. Peak Periods: The highest peaks typically occur during the summer months (June, July, and August) and sometimes extend into September. These months consistently exhibit the highest number of cases.
3. Trough Periods: The lowest points in the graph are usually observed in the winter months (December, January, and February).
4. Overall Trend: There appears to be an increasing trend in the number of cases over the years, with some fluctuations.

Now, let's analyze the monthly deaths due to Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in mainland China.

Based on the graph, we can derive the following insights:

1. Deaths are relatively low throughout the years, with occasional spikes.
2. The highest number of deaths typically occurs during the summer months, similar to the pattern observed for cases.
3. There is a decreasing trend in the number of deaths over the years, with occasional fluctuations.

It is important to note that negative values for cases and deaths in some months may indicate data errors or inconsistencies, and should be investigated further.

In summary, the analysis of the data reveals seasonal patterns, with peak periods during the summer months and trough periods during the winter months. There is an overall increasing trend in the number of cases over the years, while the number of deaths shows a decreasing trend.

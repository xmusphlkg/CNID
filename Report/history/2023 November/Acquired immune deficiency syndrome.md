## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It interferes with the body's ability to fight infections, leading to severe damage to the immune system. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection and can take years to develop, during which the virus continues to damage the immune system cells. Transmission is majorly through sexual behavior, sharing needles, or from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding. There's presently no cure, however, treatment can control HIV and prevent progression to AIDS.
## Highlights

- A consistent increase in AIDS cases over a decade, from 4,422 cases in November 2013 to 5,664 cases in November 2023. <br/>
- Mortality has also escalated, with deaths rising from 1,055 to 1,955 in the same month comparison. <br/>
- The data shows a worrying upward trajectory in both infection and mortality rates, despite fluctuation across the years. <br/>
- Current figures emphasize the need for stronger interventions to control the AIDS epidemic in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From November 2013 to November 2023, mainland China reported an increase in the number of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cases. Early data showed fluctuations without a clear trend, but by 2019 a consistent increase was evident. Despite a brief dip in cases at the start of 2020, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting reporting or healthcare access, the numbers resumed an upward trajectory. By 2021, seasonality became more apparent, with peaks often in December and troughs usually in February. A similar trend persisted into 2023, indicating an ongoing challenge in controlling the epidemic's growth.

### Deaths Analysis
AIDS-related deaths in mainland China followed a generally increasing trend from 2013 to 2023, with the highest number of deaths (2486) reported in December 2021. Seasonal patterns emerge, with death peaks typically in December and January, which correlates with the case data. However, unlike the cases, death counts showed a marked increase starting in 2018. February 2020 again saw a slight increase in deaths, despite fewer cases, likely due to healthcare system strains. Onward from 2021, the death counts remained worryingly high, suggesting that while incidence is rising, effective treatment or management of AIDS is not keeping pace simultaneously.

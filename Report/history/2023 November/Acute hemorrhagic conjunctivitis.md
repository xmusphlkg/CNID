## Introduction

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious, viral infectious disease affecting the eye's conjunctiva. It's characterized by sudden onset of severe eye pain, swelling, redness, vision disturbances, and significant eye discharge. The disease is typically self-limiting, lasting about one to two weeks. AHC is caused by two groups of viruses, Enterovirus and Coxsackievirus, and is spread through direct contact with the discharged fluid or contaminated surfaces. It poses public health concern due to its rapid spread, especially in densely populated areas.
## Highlights

- A significant outbreak occurred in September 2023 with 125,264 cases, representing an unprecedented spike in acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) cases in China. <br/>
- Despite high case numbers, there has been no reported mortality during the November 2023 period, with 4,940 cases. This attests to the non-lethal nature of AHC or effective management of severe cases. <br/>
- Since July 2023, there has been a noticeable uptick in reported AHC cases, which culminated in the September peak and has since been decreasing as of November 2023. <br/>
- The data displays a seasonal pattern with increases typically in the warmer months, peaking often in late summer or early fall, but the 2023 outbreak defies previous annual trends.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) cases in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023 demonstrate seasonal trends with peaks usually in the warmer months, as is common with enterovirus-related diseases. An extraordinary surge is observed in September 2023 with 125,264 cases, marking a dramatic increase when compared with previous years. It suggests either a significant outbreak, change in the pathogen's behavior, increased awareness, improved reporting methods, or a combination of such factors. Overall, no cases show an increasing trend over the years until the spike in 2023.

### Deaths Analysis

Deaths associated with AHC are exceptionally rare, with recorded deaths in December 2011, August 2019, and February 2020 only. Each of these instances reported a single death, except for February 2020, which reported two. The scarcity of deaths may indicate low virulence resulting in fatal outcomes or effective medical interventions preventing progression to severe disease. However, the spike in cases in 2023 without a corresponding increase in deaths might reflect an improved understanding of disease management or the emergence of a less virulent form of the pathogen.

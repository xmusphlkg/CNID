## Introduction

Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) is an infectious disease characterized by rapid onset of severe conjunctival redness, swelling, discomfort, and watery discharge, often accompanied by blurry vision. The condition is typically paired with minor systemic symptoms including fever and upper respiratory tract infection. AHC is typically caused by Enterovirus 70 or Coxsackievirus A24 variant but can also be associated with other bacterial infections. Globally, it can cause significant seasonal outbreaks.

## Highlights

- **Seasonal Trend with Unprecedented Peak**: Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases peaked unprecedentedly in September 2023, with 125,264 cases, signifying a dramatic rise compared to previous years. <br/>
- **Zero Mortality Despite Surge**: Notably, the spike in cases did not lead to an increase in mortality, with no deaths reported during the September peak. <br/>
- **Decline After Peak**: Following the September surge, cases dropped substantially to 4,940 by November, indicating a sharp decline from peak levels. <br/>
- **Incomplete Data Requires Caution**: Missing data for January and February 2013 warrants cautious interpretation of the trends for those periods. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) in China from 2010 to 2023 shows seasonal fluctuations with peaks typically in summer months, as seen in July and August. A significant surge occurred in September 2010, 2013, and notably in 2023 with 125,264 cases, suggesting potential outbreaks. The reason for such spikes could be viral mutations, environmental factors, or increased transmission rates, necessitating further investigation. Steady inter-annual presence with occasional surges indicates AHC is endemic with periodic epidemic potential. No cases are recorded in January and February 2013, possibly due to data reporting issues.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, AHC has been associated with low mortality, evidenced by only three reported deaths despite numerous cases. One death each was recorded in December 2011 and August 2019, followed by two deaths in February 2020; this could indicate either isolated severe cases or data anomalies, as AHC generally doesn't lead to fatality. The sparse number of deaths signifies efficient clinical management and low virulence of the causal pathogen, but the 2020 increase requires attention to rule out any change in disease dynamics or diagnostic criteria. Overall, the condition appears non-fatal with proper healthcare measures.

## Introduction

Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious, rapidly spreading viral eye disease. It primarily causes sudden onset of redness, tearing, and swelling in one or both eyes, often accompanied by eye pain and blurred vision. Although alarming due to its severe appearance, AHC typically resolves without treatment in one to two weeks. The disease is mainly associated with two types of enteroviruses: Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24. AHC outbreaks have occurred worldwide, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions.
## Highlights

1. There has been a sudden surge in the number of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases in mainland China, particularly in September 2023, with a total of 125,264 cases - a significant increase from the previous months. <br/>
2. Despite the fluctuations over the years, the general trend of case numbers has been downward since 2010 until 2023, when it sees a sharp rise. <br/>
3. The disease has a striking seasonality, with the highest case numbers consistently occurring from July to October. <br/>
4. The fatality rate is extremely low, with only a few cases of deaths reported from 2011-2020. However, no deaths have been recorded as of November 2023.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicates an outbreak of Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. Generally pattern reveals a cyclical rise and fall of AHC cases along the years, starting from a lower point at the beginning of the year and escalating around the summertime, with a significant peak in September. The most prominent spikes in cases were seen in September in 2010 (48,658 cases) and 2023 (125,264 cases) indicating severe outbreaks. All other years, even those without a such large spikes, maintain a consistent episodic increase in summer months.

### Deaths Analysis
Comparatively, the fatality rate documented in the data is very low, with only three recorded deaths due to AHC from 2010 to 2023, occurring in December 2011, August 2019, and February 2020. The low death rate might be attributed to effective public health measures and the typically non-lethal nature of the disease itself. It's worth noting that even in periods of significant outbreaks, the death count remained zero, which reinforces the idea that although AHC can be highly infectious, it is generally not life-threatening.

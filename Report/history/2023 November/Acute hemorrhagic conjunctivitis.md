## Introduction

Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious, rapid-onset eye infection caused primarily by two types of enteroviruses, Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackie A24. Symptoms include excessive tearing, swollen eyelids, and subconjunctival hemorrhage, leading to red, bloodshot eyes. It presents with severe eye pain. The disease is self-limiting, typically resolving within one to two weeks with no long-term effects. Epidemics are common in tropical and subtropical regions, often occurring during rainy seasons. No specific antiviral treatment is available; management is focused on relief of symptoms.
## Highlights

- A significant spike in cases of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis was observed in September 2023 with 125,264 reported cases, a dramatic increase from the prior monthly average. <br/>
- Reassuringly, by November 2023, cases decreased to 4,940, indicating a potential containment of the outbreak or the natural decline of the disease cycle. <br/>
- There have been negligible fatalities associated with the disease throughout the observed period, suggesting a low mortality risk. However, the high number of cases at certain intervals emphasizes the need for effective disease surveillance and rapid response mechanisms. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns are evident with peaks often in the warmer months (June-August), but the massive outbreak in September 2023 indicates that other factors, possibly including environmental changes or viral mutations, could be influencing disease prevalence. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicates a seasonal pattern with cases peaking from July to October annually. Notably, September 2023 saw an exceptional surge in cases (125,264), which is significantly higher than any previous month on record. This outlier suggests an acute outbreak or a reporting anomaly. The sharp increase in 2023, starting from June, culminating in September, and followed by a decline, could imply an epidemic wave of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) in the Chinese mainland. No deaths were reported for most years except for single occurrences in 2011 August and 2019 August, and a slight increase in 2020 February (2 deaths), which warrants further epidemiological investigation.

### Deaths Analysis
The dataset spanning over a decade reports almost no fatalities associated with AHC, except for isolated instances in 2011 December (1 death), 2019 August (1 death), and 2020 February (2 deaths). The sporadic nature of these deaths suggests that AHC is not typically a fatal condition, or fatalities are exceptionally rare or underreported. The double fatality reported in 2020 February could indicate an unusual variation in virulence or co-infection with other pathogens, especially considering it coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the impact on mortality is minimal, with the focus primarily on the morbidity and spread of the condition.

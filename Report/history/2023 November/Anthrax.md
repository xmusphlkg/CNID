## Introduction

Anthrax is a severe, potentially fatal disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It primarily affects livestock but can also infect humans through spores from contaminated animal products or biological warfare. Three types are cutaneous, inhalation, and gastrointestinal, each correlating with how the bacteria enter the body. Symptoms vary by type, but they commonly include skin sores, stomach pains, and severe breathing problems. Treatment includes antibiotics, which prove most effective when administered promptly after exposure. Anthrax is preventable through vaccination and improved handling of animal products.
## Highlights

- Seasonal anthrax peaks observed from July to September, pointing to environmental and agricultural influences on transmission. <br/>
- August 2023 marked the highest incident count at 123 cases yet no deaths, indicating improved disease management. <br/>
- Deaths are sporadic despite consistent case numbers yearly, suggesting effective medical interventions for anthrax. <br/>
- Fluctuating annual cases with intermittent surges denote endemic anthrax presence, highlighting the need for continued surveillance and public health initiatives. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicate a clear seasonal pattern of anthrax cases in the Chinese mainland, with a peak typically occurring from July to September each year. The highest number of reported cases in a single month is 123 cases in August 2023. Although cases occur year-round, their intensity increases during the summer and early autumn. Over the observed period, there was a visible upward trend, with the number of cases slowly increasing year on year, particularly notable in the peak months.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite fluctuations in case numbers, anthrax-associated deaths are relatively rare. The deadliest year appears to be 2012, with four deaths in September. Deaths are sporadic and do not seem to follow a strong seasonal trend, although July 2010, 2017, and 2022 also recorded multiple fatalities. The overall fatality rate appears low given the total number of cases, with a few notable aberrations such as September 2012. This suggests that while anthrax has a presence in the Chinese mainland, it is generally being managed effectively in terms of mortality.

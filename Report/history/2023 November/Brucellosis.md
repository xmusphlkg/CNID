## Introduction

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by various Brucella species, which primarily infect cattle, swine, goats, sheep, and dogs. Humans contract the disease when they come in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacteria. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, sweating, headache, and muscle/joint pain. The disease can become chronic and might affect various organs. It can be treated effectively with a specific regime of antibiotics. Preventative measures include vaccination of livestock and avoiding unpasteurized dairy products.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Brucellosis case trends in the Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023 show cyclical patterns with peaks typically in the summer months (May to August) annually. Cases gradually rise in the spring, peak in summer, and decline towards winter. From 2010 to 2023, there is a noticeable upward trend in the annual peak case numbers, indicating an increasing incidence or improved case detection over the years. Notably, in 2023, cases peak in July with 9164 reported cases, highlighting a significant increase compared to earlier years.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the reported time frame, Brucellosis-associated deaths in the Chinese mainland are rare, totaling 22 deaths from December 2010 to September 2023. The data suggests that while Brucellosis is a widespread zoonotic disease with increasing incidence, it maintains a low mortality rate. Deaths are sporadic and do not follow a distinct seasonal pattern or yearly trend. The highest number of deaths in a single month is two, observed thrice—in July 2018, September 2023, and September 2021—suggesting no significant changes in the lethality of the disease.

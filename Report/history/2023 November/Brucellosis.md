## Introduction

Brucellosis is a bacterial infection transmitted from animals to humans, typically via contaminated dairy products or direct contact with infected animals. It's caused by various Brucella species and is often characterized by intermittent fevers, sweating, fatigue, and pain in muscles/joints. Brucellosis can cause long-term complications like arthritis or inflammation in the heart if left untreated. It's prevalent in regions with less regulated animal husbandry practices. Anti-brucellosis measures include pasteurizing milk and using protective equipment when handling animals.
## Highlights

- Since 2010, there is a clear seasonal trend with cases peaking between May and July each year, indicating possible seasonal factors influencing transmission. <br/>
- There has been an overall upward trend in the number of reported cases of Brucellosis, reaching a peak in June 2022 with 9,943 cases. <br/>
- Despite the increasing number of cases over the years, the mortality rate has remained low, with zero to two deaths reported most months. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the number of cases reported is 4,540, with no deaths, suggesting continued vigilance is required but the disease has low lethality. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The trend in Brucellosis cases from 2010 to 2023 in Chinese mainland shows an increasing pattern, peaking typically between May and August, suggesting seasonal transmission. Despite fluctuations, there's a general rise in annual case counts, with the highest numbers in 2022. A slight reduction in 2023 might indicate emerging control measures or natural variability. The cyclical nature implies environmental or occupational factors influencing transmission dynamics.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality due to Brucellosis from 2010 to 2023 is incredibly low despite increasing case numbers, underscoring the non-lethal nature of the disease or effectiveness of treatment. Deaths are scarce and sporadically distributed across the years, mostly concentrated in the latter half of the year, suggesting potential seasonal effects on disease severity or late diagnosis in more severe cases. These metrics highlight the importance of public health strategies focusing on prevention and timely intervention.

## Introduction

Cholera is a infectious disease caused by the bacillus Vibrio cholerae. It's primarily spread by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with feces from an infected person. The main symptoms are profuse diarrhea and vomiting, leading to severe dehydration. Without treatment, mortality rates can be high. Even though cholera is preventable through access to safe drinking water and sanitation, it remains a global threat, mainly affecting low-income regions like parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and Haiti where water and sanitation infrastructure is poor.

## Highlights

- Seasonal pattern observed with a higher number of cases typically occurring from June to October, suggesting a possible link to seasonal factors like temperature and water-related activities. <br/>
- No cholera-related deaths reported since July and September of 2013, indicating improvements in either reporting, disease management, or both. <br/>
- Despite occasional spikes, there is a general trend of low case counts over the years, with zero cases reported in the most recent month (November 2023). <br/>
- Ongoing surveillance and preventive measures appear to be effective, as suggested by the low incidence and absence of mortality in recent years. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reflects a sporadic distribution of cholera cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023, with zero cases reported in numerous months across the years. Notably, the summer months of July and August consistently show an increase in cases, peaking in 2010 August with 63 cases. The fluctuations suggest possible seasonal influences or episodic outbreaks. However, the overall trend shows low incidence, with cases rarely exceeding single-digit numbers per month, and no significant long-term increase in cases. Crucially, there are no reports from 2013 January and February, which constitutes a gap in the dataset.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the assessed period, cholera has shown low mortality in mainland China, with only two reported deaths in 2013. The death cases occurred in the months of July and September, which align with the seasonal pattern of higher reported cases in summer. The extremely low fatality rate, especially considering the number of cases, could indicate effective disease management and treatment protocols. Since 2013, no deaths have been reported, suggesting either an absence of severe cases or continued improvements in public health interventions and medical care for cholera patients.

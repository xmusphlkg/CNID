## Introduction

Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It's primarily acquired through the ingestion of contaminated water or food. The main symptoms include acute watery diarrhea and severe dehydration, which can result in death if untreated. While it's predominantly prevalent in regions with poor sanitation, cholera can also occur in areas affected by natural disasters or conflict. Vaccines can provide temporary protection but access to safe water and improved sanitation are optimal for prevention.
## Highlights

- Seasonal pattern observed with cholera cases peaking in the summer months, diminishing towards winter; this may reflect the influence of temperature and other environmental factors on disease transmission. <br/>
- A general trend toward fewer cases is evident over the years, with occasional spikes; for example, higher occurrences were seen in August 2010 and 2018 compared to other periods, suggesting potential episodic outbreaks. <br/>
- Mortality rates have remained low, with only two registered cholera-related deaths within the 13-year span, indicating effective clinical management and possibly rapid access to healthcare. <br/>
- As of November 2023, no cholera cases or deaths were reported, which could signify successful control measures or under-reporting due to various possible reasons including a strong surveillance system, public health interventions, or seasonal patterns. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, cholera cases in mainland China showed a distinct seasonal pattern with peaks commonly occurring in the summer months, particularly from July to September. There were sporadic rises, such as in August 2010 with 63 cases, and a sizable surge in 2012 with a maximum of 18 cases in August. Notably, the number of cholera cases remained in the single digits or zero for most of the observed months across the given years, with a general trend of sporadic occurrences rather than continuous outbreaks.

### Deaths Analysis
Cholera-related mortality data from 2010 to 2023 exhibit a remarkably low fatality rate, with deaths recorded only in July and September of 2013. All other months across the years reported zero deaths, suggesting either rapid and effective treatment of cholera cases or a lower virulence of the circulating strains. The low mortality rate may also indicate a well-established public health infrastructure capable of managing choleral infections, or possibly underreporting of cholera-related deaths.

## Introduction

Dysentery is a type of gastroenteritis that results in severe diarrhea with mucus or blood in the feces. It is most often caused by the bacteria Shigella (bacillary dysentery) or the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica (amoebic dysentery). Dysentery is highly contagious, spreading through poor hygiene practices or contaminated food or water. It typically presents with abdominal pain and fever. Prompt treatment for dysentery includes rehydration and, in some cases, antibiotics. Untreated, dysentery can lead to serious complications such as dehydration or organ damage.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicates a seasonality in dysentery cases in Chinese mainland, with peaks often occurring in the summer months (May to August) and lower incidence in winter (December to March). The highest number of cases was reported in July 2014 (22,311 cases), while a general downward trend in the annual caseload is visible, reaching a low in December 2022 (1,215 cases). This could suggest improved sanitation, hygiene, and public health interventions over the years. The impact of COVID-19 related measures may also contribute to the reduced transmission seen from 2020 onwards.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality due to dysentery in Chinese mainland has remained low from 2013 to 2023, with a total of 29 deaths reported over this period, indicative of a case-fatality ratio well below 0.1%. The highest number of deaths in a single month was three, occurring in November 2013, July 2015, and January 2020. The sporadic distribution of deaths across the years indicates no clear pattern or seasonality in fatal cases, which may reflect effective clinical management and potentially the availability of healthcare services preventing progression to severe disease.

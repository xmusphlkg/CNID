## Introduction

Dysentery is an infectious disease characterized by inflammation of the intestines, primarily the colon. It results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood. The two primary types of dysentery are bacillary dysentery, commonly caused by Shigella bacteria, and amoebic dysentery, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan. Its transmission is generally through fecal-oral contamination. The illness can be severe, leading to dehydration and, at times, may be life-threatening. Treatment typically includes rehydration and, in some cases, antibiotics or amoebicides.


## Highlights

1. A considerable decline in dysentery cases over years, from 8949 in January 2010 to 1963 in November 2023, demonstrating a positive long-term trend.<br/>
2. The disease exhibits a consistent seasonal pattern, peaking during the summer months (June to August) each year.<br/>
3. The number of deaths is notably low compared to the number of cases across each year, reflecting possibly effective treatment processes in place.<br/>
4. After a substantial increase in 2012, the disease related fatalities remained consistently low, indicating improved health responses to dysentery over time.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data on Dysentery cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 indicates a significant decline over the years. The highest numbers occurred during the summer months reflecting a seasonal trend, with peaks in August in early years. From 41507 cases in August 2010, it reduced to just 4626 cases in August 2023, representing an approx. 89% decrease. This reflects effective preventive and mitigation strategies, alongside potential changes in climatic conditions or overall improvement of public health infrastructure. 

### Deaths Analysis
The death rate associated with Dysentery also decreased significantly in the same period but was relatively low from the beginning. September 2012 was an exception where 198 fatalities were reported, suggesting an outbreak or more severe strain in that period. Regardless, total mortalities usually fluctuated between 0 and 8 annually for most of the period, then reaching a consistent 0-1 per month starting from 2019. This points to enhanced medical interventions as well as effective disease management protocols over time.

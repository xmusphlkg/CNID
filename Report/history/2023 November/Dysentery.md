## Introduction

Dysentery is an infectious gastrointestinal disorder characterized by inflammation of the intestines, primarily the colon, and accompanied by severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. It is caused by either bacteria (Shigella species) or protozoa (Entamoeba histolytica), which are transmitted through contaminated food, water, or direct contact. Poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene contribute to its spread, making it more prevalent in developing countries and overcrowded environments. Early diagnosis and proper medical treatment are essential to prevent complications and contain outbreaks.
## Highlights

- There has been a consistent trend of decline in the number of dysentery cases in mainland China, from a peak in 2010 with over 41,000 cases in August to a significant drop to 1,963 cases in November 2023. <br/>
- The related deaths have also decreased markedly over the years, with occasional spikes such as the 198 deaths in September 2012. As of November 2023, there has been 1 reported death. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns indicate higher case numbers during the summer months, although these peaks have become less pronounced in recent years. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, the overall trend in both cases and deaths is downward, suggesting improved disease management and control efforts over the past decade. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Dysentery cases in the Chinese mainland peak during summer months, indicating seasonality, with an evident decreasing trend over the years. The highest number of cases was reported in August 2010 (41,507 cases), with significant declines by 2023. The apparent steady decrease could be attributed to improved sanitation, hygiene education, and possibly better disease surveillance and reporting mechanisms. The post-2014 period shows consistently lower case counts, suggesting successful interventions or changes in reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
The data presents a low mortality rate from dysentery, with deaths rarely exceeding single digits per month. A notable outlier is September 2012, with 198 deaths, which could indicate an outbreak or a data reporting anomaly. Overall, there is a declining trend in fatalities, potentially reflecting enhancements in medical treatments and access to healthcare. Since 2010, there are several months with zero deaths, showing progress in managing and controlling dysentery-related fatalities across the years.

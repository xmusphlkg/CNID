## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a parasitic infection caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. Humans contract the disease through the ingestion of parasite eggs found in the feces of infected animals, mainly dogs. This zoonotic infection can lead to the development of cysts in various organs, primarily the liver and lungs. While some cases may be asymptomatic, untreated echinococcosis can lead to severe complications and even death. Prevention strategies mainly focus on proper hygiene and control of the definitive hosts, such as deworming dogs and restricting their access to infected carcasses.
## Highlights

- Fluctuations in Echinococcosis cases in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 highlight a long-term persistence of the disease with periodic peaks. <br/>
- The highest number of cases was reported in December 2010 (1065 cases), followed by a significant spike in March 2017 (1077 cases), indicating possible seasonal or annual clusters. <br/>
- Mortality associated with Echinococcosis has been very low over the years, with only sporadic death occurrences, suggesting either a low fatality rate or effective clinical management of cases. <br/>
- The data for 2023, as of November, indicates a stabilization of case numbers with no reported deaths, which could reflect ongoing public health interventions and awareness programs. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Echinococcosis cases in mainland China from January 2010 to November 2023 exhibit seasonal variability and an overall slight increasing trend. Case numbers peak in the warmer months, notably August and November, with the highest incidence in November 2017 (1,077 cases). Dramatic spikes appear recurrently; December 2010 (1,065 cases) being prominent. A substantial dip in cases occurs in February 2020 (91 cases), likely influenced by major public health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-2020, there's a gradual resumption towards the previous baseline.

### Deaths Analysis
Echinococcosis-associated mortality is extremely low over the observed period, with a total of 11 reported deaths against a backdrop of fluctuating case numbers. Deaths are sporadic, with no apparent monthly pattern or increasing trend. A notable peak in fatalities occurs in February 2019, the only month reporting two deaths. Overall, the lethality of echinococcosis remains consistently low, with most months recording zero deaths despite the variance in case numbers, indicating effective clinical management or a less virulent disease presentation.

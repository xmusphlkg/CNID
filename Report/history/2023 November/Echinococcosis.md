## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a parasitic infection caused by the larval stages of the Echinococcus species. Transmission occurs from ingesting food or water contaminated with the parasite's eggs, often from domestic or wild canines. It primarily affects the liver, but can also infect lungs and other organs. Its characteristics include long incubation period, cyst formation, and potential for severe health complications, potentially leading to death if untreated. The World Health Organization considers it a neglected tropical disease.

## Highlights

1. Echinococcosis shows a clear cyclic trend throughout the years, peaking towards the end of the year, particular in December, and being lowest around early of the year.<br/>
2. There is a general decline in both the number of cases and deaths over time. This might be due to better healthcare interventions or changes in transmission dynamics. As of November 2023, cases were at 387 with no reported deaths.<br/>
3. Very few deaths are reported, indicating that while the disease may be prevalent, it may not be causing high mortality.<br/>
4. A drastic drop in the number of cases is observed in 2020, potentially due to Covid-related changes such as lockdowns affecting healthcare service utilization or reporting.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Echinococcosis in mainland China portrayed a consistent trend with a relative increase and decrease throughout the year, but no significant peaks or drop-offs, indicating a continued exposure to the infection source. The cases significantly fluctuated, but there was no substantial upward or downward trend over time. A noteworthy surge occurred in December 2010, and there were spikes every year-end, possibly due to increased testing or reporting during these periods. The recorded cases were the lowest during the early years reviewed and progressively increased, which may imply an enhanced detection rate or a rise in infection.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality rate for Echinococcosis is relatively low, with only sporadic deaths reported from 2010 to 2023. This indicates the disease's low fatality, potentially a result of effective treatments, and general healthcare improvement. A peak in deaths is noted in February 2019 with two recorded deaths, but this does not appear to correlate with the number of cases that year, suggesting other factors might be influencing the fatality. It's also worth noting that a number of months across all years had zero reported deaths, suggesting successful intervention methods or milder disease forms.

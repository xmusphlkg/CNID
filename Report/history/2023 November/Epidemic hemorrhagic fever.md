## Introduction

Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) is an infectious disease typically caused by hantaviruses and transmitted through rodent carriers. It is characterized by fluctuating fever, nausea, body pain, and, in severe cases, bleeding disorders and organ dysfunction. EHF presents worldwide but displays high incidence in Eastern Asia. Its transmission primarily occurs via inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta. Despite its overall low mortality rate, prompt diagnosis and supportive care are essential to manage complications. Effective rodent control remains the paramount preventive measure.
## Highlights

1. A seasonal pattern is apparent with peak cases typically observed in November and lowest in August.<br/>
2. Case counts have declined since 2010 with a significant drop from 2022 to 2023.<br/>
3. Mortality rates vary, but there has been a notable decrease over time.<br/>
4. As of November 2023, the number of cases is 1320 with 3 deaths, continuing the overall decreasing trend.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Epidemic hemorrhagic fever in mainland China revealed a consistent pattern over the years. A cyclical trend was observed with peak occurrence during colder months (Oct-Nov-Dec) with November being the highest. This may suggest a link with climatic and seasonal factors for disease transmission. It's worth noting that the lowest number of cases occurred predominantly in the warmer months and the number declined significantly after 2021. This could be due to escalated public health measures, weather conditions or changes in the infecting agent itself.

### Deaths Analysis
Evidence clearly indicates a strong correlation between cases and deaths. The data reveals a similar seasonal pattern in fatalities, which are also highest in the colder months (Nov-Dec-Jan). A significant anomaly was observed in September 2012 with a substantial increase in deaths, possibly linked to a virulent strain or a breakdown in healthcare provision. Post 2021, the death toll substantially went down, which could be due to improved treatment, diagnosis and intervention strategies. However, the case fatality rate appears to have remained relatively stable during these years.

## Introduction

Epidemic hemorrhagic fever, also known as Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), is a severe viral disease caused primarily by Hantaviruses. It is transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected rodent urine, droppings, or saliva. Characteristics include sudden fever, chills, headaches, back pain, and severe abdominal pain. Hemorrhaging and kidney failure are severe complications. It escalates globally, with primary incidents found in Asia and Europe, presenting a significant public health concern due to its high infectivity and mortality rates.
## Highlights

- The number of Epidemic hemorrhagic fever cases in November 2023 (1320 cases) has significantly decreased from its peak in November 2012 (3000 cases). <br/>
- Mortality in November 2023 has notably declined to 3 deaths compared to high mortality observed in the same month of previous years, such as 32 deaths in November 2010. <br/>
- Since the beginning of the year 2023, there has been a consistent pattern of low mortality associated with the disease, with no more than 3 deaths reported per month. <br/>
- The trend in 2023, leading up to November, shows a gradual decrease in cases with a stable low number of associated deaths, indicating an improved control over the spread of the disease compared to previous years.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Analysis of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) cases in China from 2010 to November 2023 indicates a seasonal pattern with peaks often occurring in late autumn. A significantly high number of cases are reported each November, except for 2017 when the peak was in December. The month with the highest case number was November 2012, with 3000 reported cases. Data shows a substantial decrease in cases starting from January 2023 through September, with a moderate increase in October and a notable spike in November 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality data associated with EHF follows a less pronounced seasonal trend than case occurrence, but still generally mirrors the peaks in cases. The deadliest month was September 2012, which is an anomaly with 150 deaths, significantly higher than any other month. December 2010 and November 2018 share the second-highest mortality count with 33 deaths each. Deaths saw a notable decline in 2023, reaching single-digit numbers, with zero deaths reported in February, March, May, July, August, and September, signifying potential improvements in medical interventions or reporting accuracy.

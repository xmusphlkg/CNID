## Introduction

Filariasis is a parasitic disease caused predominantly by three species of thread-like nematode worms, Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. Spread by the bites of infected mosquitoes, the worms reside in and damage the human lymphatic system, occasionally leading to permanent disability. Manifestations include swollen limbs (elephantiasis), genital disease, and recurrent acute attacks. Globally, over 120 million people are affected, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a public health problem recognized by the World Health Organization.
## Highlights

- Filariasis in Chinese mainland has demonstrated exceptional control, with mostly zero reported cases and zero deaths from January 2010 through November 2023. <br/>
- Occasional single-case spikes were observed in August 2011, November 2014, and August 2021; however, these instances did not result in any reported deaths. <br/>
- The zero-case trend post-August 2021 suggests continuing effective disease surveillance, prevention, and potentially successful elimination strategies. <br/>
- No further escalation is noticed following the single-case occurrences, indicating efficient containment and response by public health authorities. <br/>

The data reflects an overall well-managed epidemiological situation with respect to Filariasis in the Chinese mainland up to November 2023.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from Chinese mainland shows an exceptional elimination of filariasis from 2010 to 2023, with only two isolated cases reported in August 2011 and August 2017. This suggests a highly effective control and elimination strategy, underscoring China's commitment to combating filariasis as part of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. The maintenance of zero case reports for extended periods reflects sustained interruption of transmission and is indicative of a successful public health intervention.

### Deaths Analysis
Filariasis-related fatalities are absent throughout the reported period from 2010 to 2023. The zero death toll correlates with the low incidence of cases and points toward either the benign nature of the infections reported or the efficacy of the health care system in treating and managing those cases. The continued absence of deaths over multiple years further substantiates the effective control measures and suggests that filariasis does not currently pose a significant public health threat in Chinese mainland.

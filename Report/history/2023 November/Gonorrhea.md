## Introduction

Gonorrhea, a highly contagious sexually transmitted infection, is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It affects both men and women, primarily impacting mucous membranes of the reproductive tract, including the cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes in women, and the urethra in both genders. It can also affect the throat, eyes, and rectum. Common symptoms include painful urination and yellow or green discharge. Without treatment, gonorrhea can cause significant complications, including infertility. Prevention is best achieved through safe sexual practices.

## Highlights

1. Overall, there appears to be a general trend of increasing cases of gonorrhea over the years although there is significant variability within the year.<br/>
2. Remarkably, despite increases in cases, the death rate associated with gonorrhea is very low, approaching zero.<br/>
3. There was a drop in the number of Gonorrhea cases in 2020 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the cases rapidly increased afterward.<br/>
4. As of November 2023, there were 10,065 cases reported with no deaths, indicating ongoing transmission but little severe disease.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
During the 13-year period from 2010 to 2023, the number of gonorrhea cases in Mainland China showed a general trend of annually peaking in summer months, with a notable increase starting from 2016. The lower number of cases reported in February 2020 suggest a possible impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a gradual increase is observed in the second half of the same year. The number of cases showed a decline again from the end of 2022, reaching its lowest in December 2022. The data shows an increase again in August 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
Death data from gonorrhea over the reviewed period is vastly sporadic with several months reporting no fatalities. The overall mortality rate seems significantly low given the large number of cases, suggesting that gonorrhea is a treatable condition. One noticeable surge in death cases is in September 2012 with 10 deaths reported. The record high fatality was in January 2020 (4 deaths). In recent years from 2018 to 2023, deaths occur with almost no distinct pattern, highlighting the unpredictability of severe outcomes in sexual transmitted infections.

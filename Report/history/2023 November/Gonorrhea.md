## Introduction

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It's often asymptomatic, but symptoms when present can include painful urination, pelvic pain, and discharge in both men and women. It can cause serious health complications if left untreated, including infertility. It is most prevalent in young adults. The infection can be diagnosed through laboratory tests and is typically treated with antibiotics. It is preventable through safe sex practices including consistent use of condoms.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Gonorrhea cases in the Chinese mainland display a noticeable trend over the observed period. Starting at 9079 cases in November 2013, a peak of 13803 cases occurred in August 2017, indicating an increasing trend. After this peak, the numbers fluctuated, with notable dips in February of each year, potentially due to the Chinese New Year affecting reporting and clinic operation. A significant drop to 3524 cases was observed in February 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic onset. Post-2020, cases have gradually increased but have not reached pre-pandemic levels.

### Deaths Analysis
Gonorrhea-associated deaths in the Chinese mainland were rare from 2013 to 2023, with a total of 13 reported deaths. The first death was recorded in May 2014, hinting at a potential data reporting change or a severe complication case since gonorrhea rarely results in mortality. Deaths remained sporadic and did not exceed four in a single month (January 2020). Yearly, deaths are nearly non-existent, indicating effective gonorrhea management or possibly underreported mortality related to the disease.

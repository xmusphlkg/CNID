## Introduction

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is often asymptomatic, but symptoms can include painful urination and abnormal genital discharge. Complications can lead to infertility and an increased risk of other sexually transmitted diseases. It can also be transmitted from mother to baby during childbirth. Antibiotics can effectively treat Gonorrhea, but resistant strains are increasing worldwide. Prevention strategies include using condoms and regular screenings for sexually active individuals.
## Highlights

- A persistent upward trend in gonorrhea cases over the 13-year period, with fluctuations that may be seasonal or related to specific interventions or reporting practices. <br/>
- Noticeable decline in cases beginning in 2020, possibly attributable to public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a rebound to pre-pandemic numbers by 2023. <br/>
- Very low mortality associated with gonorrhea, with occasional deaths recorded, signaling either rare complications or reporting errors. <br/>
- The latest data from November 2023 shows a relatively stable situation with 10,065 cases and no deaths, suggesting ongoing transmission but effective management of severe outcomes. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Gonorrhea cases in the Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 demonstrate significant fluctuations with an overarching increasing trend. Initially, cases ranged from 6,660 in February 2010 to 9,769 in August of the same year. A gradual rise is evident with a peak of 13,803 cases in August 2017. Notably, a sharp decrease occurs in February 2020 to 3,524 cases, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures affecting testing and reporting. The trend resumes an upward trajectory post-2020.

### Deaths Analysis
Death occurrences due to gonorrhea in the Chinese mainland are extremely rare across the years studied. The reported deaths remained at zero until a single death was recorded in January 2011, with occasional isolated incidents thereafter. An unexpected anomaly of 10 deaths in September 2012 stands out, requiring verification or further investigation into the cause. Post-2012, the annual death count doesn't exceed two, with no clear temporal pattern. Deaths are disconnected from the number of cases, suggesting effective management of gonorrhea complications.

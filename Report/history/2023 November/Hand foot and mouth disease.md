## Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a highly contagious infection often affecting children under five years old. It's caused primarily by the Coxsackievirus. Symptoms include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash on the hands and feet. It spreads through contact with nose, throat, or stool particles of an infected person. While uncomfortable, itâ€™s generally not serious and most people recover within 7-10 days without medical treatment. Vaccines aren't available for HFMD, but the risk can be reduced with good hygiene.
## Highlights

- Seasonal trends in HFMD cases evident, with peaks in May-June and troughs in winter. A dramatic decline in cases began in 2020. <br/>
- Fatality rates have shown a steady decrease, with no deaths reported since the latter half of 2021, suggesting improved disease control. <br/>
- The latest data from November 2023 indicates a continued low number of cases (92,955) with no fatalities, aligning with the general downward trend in severity. <br/>
- Public health measures and awareness likely contributed to the sustained reduction in both incidence and mortality of HFMD.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) incidents in Chinese mainland exhibit notable seasonal and annual trends. Noteworthy are the surges in cases often occurring from April to July each year, possibly linked to cyclical factors conducive to enterovirus spread. After 2014's peak incidence, a gradual decline transpires, though sporadic rises are still evident. The years 2020 and 2021 markedly diverge from the trend with reduced cases, likely due to public health interventions amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2023, case numbers regain momentum, approaching pre-pandemic figures.

### Deaths Analysis
The fatality occurrences due to HFMD display a descending trend over the years. The peak of death cases coincides with the highest incidence of infections in 2014. Despite the fluctuations in monthly case rates, death rates significantly decrease and stabilize post-2014. From 2020 onwards, mortality is virtually eliminated, which could be attributed to improved disease management, heightened awareness, and effective containment measures synergizing with pandemic counteractions. As of 2023, the mortality has been consistently at zero, showing remarkable control over the fatal outcomes of the disease.

## Introduction

Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a contagious viral infection mainly affecting young children. It is most often caused by the Coxsackievirus. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, and a rash on the hands and feet, often accompanied by mouth sores. Transmission typically occurs through contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces. Though generally mild with recovery in one to two weeks, rare complications can occur. There's no specific cure, and treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms.


## Highlights

1. Cyclical Trend: The Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) demonstrates a clear cyclic trend in China with an increase in the number of cases typically peaking around the months of May to July, and decreasing significantly towards the end of the year. This trend repeats annually. <br/> 
2. Overall Reduction in Cases: Compared to previous years, notably 2010-2014, the number of HFMD cases has generally declined from the start of 2015, suggesting effective interventions or changing dynamics. <br/>
3. Decrease in Mortality: While the incidence is high, the mortality rate of HMFD has been consistently low and shows a further downward trend in recent years, indicating improved disease management and treatment outcomes. <br/>
4. Current Situation: As of November 2023, there has been a spike in the number of cases in the summer months, similar to historical trends, however, the case count (92,955) is considerably lower compared to the same period in previous peak years. Importantly, there have been zero recorded deaths this month.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) appears to be seasonally endemic to mainland China, with peaks typically observed between April to July each year, followed by a gradual decrease towards the end of the year. The overall trend from 2010-2023 indicates a steady rise in cases, suggesting the disease remains a significant health challenge. Exceptional surges were seen in 2010, 2014, and notably in 2023. However, there was an unusual dip in case numbers observed in 2020, possibly related to increased hygiene practices or social distancing measures introduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths due to HFMD in mainland China show a steady decline from 2010 through 2023, despite the rise in the number of cases over the same period. Intermittent spikes in fatalities appear to correspond to the peak case periods, predominantly around May and June, indicative of seasonal influences. This suggests improvements in public health interventions, detection methods, and perhaps the effectiveness of treatment options over the years. The drastic drop in deaths from 2017 onwards, sustained through 2023, indicates notable progress in managing the disease's mortality.

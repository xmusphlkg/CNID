## Introduction

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV). It is primarily spread when an individual unknowingly ingests the virus from objects, food, or drinks contaminated by small, undetected amounts of feces from an infected person. Hepatitis A does not typically cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and acute liver failure. There's no specific treatment for Hepatitis A. Prevention includes proper hygiene practices such as handwashing and vaccination.
## Highlights

- A continuous decrease in Hepatitis A cases is observed from 2013 to 2023, indicating an effective control of the disease in Chinese mainland. <br/>
- Despite occasional spikes, such as in September 2014 with 2656 cases, the overall trend shows a reduction with November 2023 reporting 1056 cases. <br/>
- Death counts have remained low through the years, and there have been no reported deaths from 2020 January to November 2023, reflecting possible improvements in healthcare management. <br/>
- The data suggests successful public health interventions, although periodic surveillance remains critical to maintain control of Hepatitis A in China.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From November 2013 to November 2023, cases of Hepatitis A in mainland China showed a general decline. The initial cases hovered around 2,000 per month, with occasional peaks exceeding 2,500 in September and October of 2014. Thereafter, a gradual decrease was observed, particularly pronounced after 2019. A significant drop is noticeable from January 2020 onwards, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic onset, possibly due to heightened hygiene measures. Since then, cases maintained lower levels, dipping below 1,000 monthly from 2021, with the lowest recorded at 532 in December 2022.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the decade, deaths associated with Hepatitis A in mainland China were very low, totaling 26. The virus exhibited low fatality, with most months reporting zero deaths. Notable spikes occurred with four deaths in December 2015 and two on several occasions in mid-2014 and mid-2015. Since then, deaths remained predominantly at zero with rare single fatalities sporadically dispersed throughout the years up to August 2022. The data suggests effective management in preventing fatalities from Hepatitis A despite the occurrence of cases.

## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a potentially severe liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can be an acute short-term, or chronic long-term, disease that can lead to liver damage, liver cancer, or even death. The virus is transmitted through contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids. The infection can be prevented through vaccination. Chronic Hepatitis B is common worldwide, affecting hundreds of millions of individuals, predominantly in the Asia-Pacific region and Sub-Saharan Africa.
## Highlights

- A rising trend in Hepatitis B cases is evident, with an increase from 74,790 cases in January to 132,270 cases in November 2023. <br/>
- Deaths remain low and stable, slightly increasing to 35 in November 2023 from 18 in early 2023. <br/>
- The highest case count within the year occurred in August with 138,875 cases, suggesting a potential seasonal increase. <br/>
- Mortality control is effective, signaling progress in China's health interventions and Hepatitis B management.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, the annual pattern of reported Hepatitis B cases in China mainland displays recurrent fluctuations, with peaks generally in March or July. After peaking at 138,875 cases in August 2023, a noticeable trend of increasing case numbers is evident, particularly in the years post-2020. This rise could reflect an actual increase in hepatitis B incidence, a boost in reporting accuracy, or heightened public health surveillance. Notably, December 2022 shows an abnormal dip, which warrants further investigation to understand potential underlying factors or reporting irregularities.

### Deaths Analysis
Reported deaths from Hepatitis B over the same period present low and relatively stable figures with monthly counts generally not surpassing 80. The highest reported mortality was in January 2020 with 80 deaths. Thereâ€™s an apparent decline in fatality reports after 2020, with deaths seldom exceeding 50. This could suggest improvements in healthcare access, treatment efficacy, and possibly vaccine coverage. However, the sudden decrease in deaths to less than half post-2020 raises questions about consistency in data reporting or may reflect indirect effects of health systems' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

(Note: The context behind the fluctuations and changes in reported cases and deaths, such as healthcare system shifts, policy changes, or external factors like pandemics, would require a comprehensive epidemiological investigation to provide a conclusive explanation.)

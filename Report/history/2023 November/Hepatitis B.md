## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening viral infection that attacks the liver, leading to both acute and chronic disease. It is most commonly spread through exposure to infectious blood, semen or other body fluids, often through unprotected sexual contact, mother-to-child transmission during childbirth, and sharing needles during drug use. Chronic Hepatitis B can lead to severe health issues, including cirrhosis or liver cancer. Preventive measures include vaccination and safe practices concerning blood, body fluids, and sexual contact.
## Highlights

- An upward trend in Hepatitis B cases from 2010 to 2023, peaking at 132,270 cases in November 2023.<br/>
- Death counts have remained low and stable, with notable lows in January and February 2023 at 18 deaths each, suggesting effective management.<br/>
- Seasonal patterns are indicated, with case surges typically in March and reduced incidence towards year's end, particularly in December 2022 with only 59,498 cases.<br/>
- The contrast between rising cases and stable mortality rates implies successful healthcare interventions over the period analyzed.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicates a recurrent pattern in the reported cases of Hepatitis B in Chinese mainland, with a notable periodic increase typically observed around March each year. Despite fluctuations, there is an upward trend with the highest recorded cases in August 2023 at 138,875. An exception to the pattern is the evident decline in cases in February 2020, possibly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Over time, while oscillations persist, there seems to be an increasing annual baseline, suggesting a need for heightened preventive measures.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths from Hepatitis B in Chinese mainland show considerable variability month-to-month, but without a clear increasing or decreasing trend over the years. The highest number of deaths within the observed period occurred in January 2020, with 80 deaths, which is an outlier when considering the relatively stable mortality rate observed across the dataset. The overall death counts hover around a median value, indicating consistent case fatality rates. However, a significant dip in mortalities is recorded from May 2012 onward, which might reflect improvements in treatment efficacy or reporting accuracy.

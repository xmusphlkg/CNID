## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a potentially severe liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is a major global health problem and can cause chronic infection, leading to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. Symptoms include fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and jaundice, though many people show no symptoms at initial stages. Vaccination can prevent the infection and is usually given as a series of three injections over a six-month period.
## Highlights

- Hepatitis B cases in Mainland China have seen a general increasing trend since early 2020, with a notable spike in November 2023, reporting 132,270 cases and 35 deaths.
<br/>
- The mortality rate associated with hepatitis B has remained relatively low over the years, with noticeable drops in the number of deaths over time, suggesting possible improvements in management and treatment.
<br/>
- The highest number of reported cases in the data set occurred in August 2023, with 138,875 cases, but the death count remained comparably low at 22 deaths, indicating a disconnect between infection rates and mortality.
<br/>
- There was a significant dip in reported cases and deaths in December 2022, indicating potential seasonality, data collection issues, or disease control interventions that temporarily reduced case numbers.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, Hepatitis B cases in mainland China showed fluctuations with peaks notably in March and August, suggesting possible seasonal trends. An unexpected decline in cases was observed in February 2020, which coincides with the COVID-19 outbreak, possibly due to reduced healthcare access or reporting. Starting from 2023, a substantial increase in reported cases is observed, indicating either a rise in infections, enhanced surveillance, or improved diagnostic capabilities consequently capturing more cases.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to Hepatitis B from 2010 to 2023 present an overall steady pattern, with monthly fatalities rarely exceeding 80 deaths. A spike is seen in January 2020, which may correspond with the pandemic's onset affecting healthcare systems. Death counts notably decreased in 2022 and continued to remain low into 2023, possibly reflecting advancements in treatment, vaccination efforts, or underreporting. Despite the rise in cases in 2023, death rates did not increase proportionally, suggesting improved clinical management of Hepatitis B or reporting discrepancies.

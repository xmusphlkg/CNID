## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as Delta Hepatitis, is a serious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis D virus (HDV). It is unique as it can only infect individuals who already have Hepatitis B, leading to more severe complications. Transmission occurs through direct contact with infected blood or bodily fluids, similar to Hepatitis B. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, including flu-like symptoms, dark urine, and abdominal pain. Vaccination against Hepatitis B is the most effective prevention method for Hepatitis D. Antibody testing is used for diagnosis, with treatment options being limited.
## Highlights

- Declining Trend: Hepatitis D cases in the Chinese mainland show a decrease from 60 cases in January 2016 to 19 in November 2023. <br/>
- No Mortality: Throughout the years 2016-2023, there were no reported deaths due to Hepatitis D, indicating effective disease management. <br/>
- Annual Fluctuations: The data reveals yearly case number variations, suggesting possible seasonal impacts or reporting inconsistencies. <br/>
- Ongoing Presence: The persistent reporting of cases each month points to the need for continued monitoring and preventive strategies. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2016 to 2023, reported Hepatitis D cases on the Chinese mainland showed an overall downward trend. Initially fluctuating between 30 to 60 cases per month, there was a notable decrease after 2020, with cases consistently staying below 30. A slight uptick is observed in late 2021, followed by a stable reduction in 2022. Peaks often occur mid-year or late in the year, with May and September of some years like 2017 and 2019 showing higher incidences. The variability between months indicates irregular outbreak patterns or variability in surveillance/reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the 2016-2023 period, there have been no reported deaths from Hepatitis D in the Chinese mainland, according to the data provided. This could suggest effective clinical management and adequate treatment protocols for cases that did emerge. Despite the presence of reported cases, the zero mortality rate also prompts a reevaluation of either the virulence of the virus within the population, access to healthcare services, or the accuracy of the reported death data, which may not capture all Hepatitis D-related deaths if such occurred.

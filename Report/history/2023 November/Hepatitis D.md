## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also referred to as Delta hepatitis, is a serious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis D virus (HDV). It is unique in that it only develops in individuals already infected with Hepatitis B virus. Individuals with dual infection of Hepatitis B and D can experience more severe illness, rapid progression to liver damage such as cirrhosis, and increased risk of liver cancer. While there are vaccines for Hepatitis B, none currently exist for Hepatitis D. Prevention primarily involves Hepatitis B vaccination and practicing safe behaviors.

## Highlights

- The data shows that Hepatitis D cases in mainland China have shown a significant downward trend from 2016 to 2023, witnessing a reduction in the monthly case count from around 40-60 cases in 2016, to around 10-20 cases in 2023.<br/>
- Despite fluctuations in the monthly counts, the overall trend has remained consistent. Year to year, a reduction in cases is apparent, especially contrasting the year 2016 and 2023.<br/>
- Remarkably, despite the substantial number of cases, no deaths linked directly to Hepatitis D were reported from 2016 through November 2023.<br/>
- This trend of declining case counts and zero deaths indicates effective disease management and potential successful vaccination or treatment strategies against Hepatitis D in China.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reveals a gradual reduction in Hepatitis D cases in mainland China from 2016 to 2023. There was an initial high of 60 cases per month in January 2016, but this declined gradually. The highest monthly case count was observed in 2017, peaking at 59, then steadily tapered down. By 2020, the average case count per month had drastically reduced, hitting lows of 12 cases per month, and maintaining an average of around 20 cases per month in 2023. Although brief upswings were observed periodically, the overall trend is successfully decreased Hepatitis D cases.

### Deaths Analysis
Remarkably, mainland China reported no fatalities due to Hepatitis D from 2016 through 2023. This could reflect effective interventions to manage the disease, including comprehensive treatment and prevention strategies. The effective zero mortality rate over multiple years may indicate strong public health infrastructure, fastidious monitoring, and successful therapeutic interventions. However, it may also reflect underreporting, necessitating continued vigilance and rigorous data collection methods to ensure the most accurate epidemiological understanding of Hepatitis D in mainland China.

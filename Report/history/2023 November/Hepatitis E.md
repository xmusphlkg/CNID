## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV). Found in fecal matter and contracted through the consumption of contaminated water or food, it is most prevalent in areas with poor sanitation systems. The disease displays symptoms such as jaundice, fatigue, and nausea, often resolving itself within a few weeks. However, it can pose severe risks to pregnant women and individuals with weakened immune systems. Vaccines are available, but not widely in all countries.
## Highlights

- A declining trend in Hepatitis E cases is observed from a peak in 2011 (4262 cases in March). The number of cases decreased significantly by 2022, with a low of 1187 cases in December. <br/>
- Mortality rates associated with Hepatitis E have remained consistently low over the studied period, with zero to six deaths per month â€“ indicating a relatively low fatality rate of the disease. <br/>
- A slight increase in Hepatitis E cases is seen in early 2023, following the low of December 2022; March and April report 3117 and 3006 cases respectively, with numbers remaining stable through November. <br/>
- Despite the fluctuations in case numbers, the overall trend indicates a controlled situation with minimal fatalities, suggesting effective management of Hepatitis E in mainland China as of November 2023.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Hepatitis E cases in mainland China from January 2010 to November 2023 show seasonal fluctuations with peaks often in the spring months, particularly March and April. The highest case count was observed in March 2011 (4262 cases), with notable peaks in subsequent years. Reported cases dipped notably in 2020, potentially due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions reducing transmission opportunities. By 2023, case numbers partially rebounded, stabilizing above 2500 cases from spring through autumn, implying restoration of typical transmission dynamics or reporting practices post-pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths from Hepatitis E across the same timeframe are relatively low, with no clear seasonal trend and monthly death counts mostly below 6. The highest mortality was reported in December 2017, with 6 deaths. Despite fluctuations in case numbers, fatalities remained modest, indicating either a low case-fatality ratio or underreporting of deaths. The years 2020-2023 showed no deaths exceeding 2 in any given month, potentially reflecting improved management, healthcare interventions, or less severe disease strains.

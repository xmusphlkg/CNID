## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV), typically transmitted through the fecal-oral route, primarily due to contaminated water. It is prevalent in developing countries with poor sanitation. While most infections are mild or asymptomatic, it can be severe or fatal in certain cases, particularly in pregnant women or individuals with compromised immune systems. Chronic cases, although far rarer, are still a concern, especially in transplant recipients. As there is no specific treatment for Hepatitis E, prevention through adequate sanitation and vaccine development is critical.

## Highlights

1. There has been a general downward trend in the number of Hepatitis E cases between 2010 and 2023 in mainland China, with some recurrent seasonal spikes, often peaking around March. <br/>
2. Despite the overall decrease in the number of cases, there wasn't an appreciable decrease in the number of monthly deaths associated with Hepatitis E over the same period. <br/>
3. Since 2019, cases have frequently dropped below 2000 per month, but there's a noticeable resurgence in 2023, particularly from March onwards. <br/>
4. As of November 2023, there are 2751 reported cases of Hepatitis E in mainland China, but no deaths recorded.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the period from 2010 to 2023, the incidence of Hepatitis E cases in mainland China demonstrated moderate fluctuation with slight decreasing trends towards later years. Peak months with notably high incidences appeared mainly in the first and third quarters of each year. The recorded number of cases achieved highest values in March of 2011, 2017, and 2023, potentially signaling a trend for increased transmission during these periods. Conversely, a clear drop in Hepatitis E cases is observed in February of 2020, possibly due to influence from the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to Hepatitis E over the same period has remained consistently and remarkably low. The maximum reported fatalities per month was 6, occurring in February 2010, April 2011, and December 2017. While there are minor occasional elevations, there is no distinguishable annual or seasonal pattern in the death count data, and overall the Hepatitis E mortality rate appears to remain significantly low. Notably, there is a visible increase in the number of zero-death months in the later years, suggesting an improved response or medical treatment capability.

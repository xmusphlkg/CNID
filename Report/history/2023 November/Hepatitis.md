## Introduction

Hepatitis is a broad term referring to inflammation of the liver, primarily caused by viral infections but can also result from toxins, certain drugs, heavy alcohol use, or autoimmune conditions. The most common types are Hepatitis A, B, and C. It can present either in acute or chronic form. Acute hepatitis often resolves on its own while chronic hepatitis persist for long periods, leading potentially to serious complications like cirrhosis, liver cancer, or liver failure. Vaccines are available for prevention, specifically for Hepatitis A and B.
## Highlights

- Notable increase in hepatitis cases from November 2013 (113,300 cases) to November 2023 (156,977 cases). <br/>
- Sharp rise in hepatitis-related deaths in 2023, peaking at 327 in November; markedly higher compared to previous years. <br/>
- Significant spike in mortality throughout 2023, surpassing 100 deaths per month starting in January. <br/>
- Elevated case fatality rates from June to November 2023 indicate potential changes in viral virulence, healthcare system challenges, or shifts in reporting.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
A review of the Hepatitis case data from the Chinese mainland from 2013 to 2023 reveals fluctuations with a noticeable increase in reported cases over time. November 2013 recorded 113,300 cases, with cases peaking at 166,606 in August 2023 indicating an upward trend. Seasonal variation is apparent, as cases rise in the warmer months, March through August, with intermittent surges, the largest being in March 2023 with 155,705 cases. The decrease to 72,630 cases in December 2022 and subsequent rapid increase suggests potential underreporting or delayed diagnosis.

### Deaths Analysis
The analysis of Hepatitis-related deaths from 2013 to 2023 indicates a relatively stable pattern initially, with deaths typically ranging between 25-80 per month. However, a drastic escalation in fatalities is observed beginning in April 2023, when deaths almost doubled from the previous month, reaching 96. The subsequent months show a continued rise in mortality, culminating in a record high of 327 deaths in November 2023. This concerning surge suggests a worsened clinical profile of the disease or healthcare system challenges.

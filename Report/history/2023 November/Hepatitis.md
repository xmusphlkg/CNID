## Introduction

Hepatitis is a broad term referring to inflammation of the liver, primarily caused by viral infections. The most common types are Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. While Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water, Hepatitis B, C, and D usually occur due to parenteral contact with infected bodily fluids or from mother to child at birth. Symptoms include fatigue, yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice), abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Untreated or chronic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer.

## Highlights

1. The number of Hepatitis cases in November 2023 experienced a significant spike, with 156977 cases observed, following a steady increase during the year. <br/>
2. Despite the general rise in cases, there was a concerning, notable increase in the number of deaths from Hepatitis in 2023, reaching a record high of 327 in November.<br/>
3. Overall, there's a concerning trend of increasing deaths in 2023 compared to previous years, indicating a possible emergence of a more lethal strain, failure in preventive measures, or an increase in disease severity. <br/>
4. Downward trends in case numbers were occasionally observed, such as in December 2022, suggesting seasonal influences or successful intervention points that could be further investigated. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Data on Hepatitis cases in Chinese mainland spanning from 2010 to 2023 indicate some trends. Yearly case rates fluctuated between 100,000 to 170,000, indicating a long-term endemic, with highest peaks occurring predominantly in spring and summer months (March to October). This could be accredited to vital seasonality factors impacting viral transmission mode. Noticeably, there seemed to be a significant rise in recorded cases from late 2022, peaking in August 2023. This surge suggests a possible outbreak or an advancement in Hepatitis diagnostics within the country for this period.

### Deaths Analysis

The trend in Hepatitis-related deaths in China over this period is fairly stable, usually standing below 100 per month, till early 2023. This suggests effective control and/or treatment measures were implemented. However, an alarming escalation in death count is observed from April 2023, reaching its highest point in November. This dramatic increase might indicate a change in the disease's severity, a strain evolution, or compromised medical infrastructure perhaps due to an overwhelming number of cases or other concurrent crises.

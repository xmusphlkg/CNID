## Introduction

Hepatitis is a viral infection that primarily targets the liver, causing inflammation, and potentially leading to severe liver damage. It manifests in five types: A, B, C, D, and E. Each type is caused by a different virus and varies in transmission methods and severity. Hepatitis B and C often lead to chronic diseases in hundreds of millions around the world and are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by consumption of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis D only occurs in people already infected with Hepatitis B.
## Highlights

- Hepatitis cases in Chinese mainland show a notable and concerning increase in fatalities from May 2023, rising from 170 deaths to a peak of 327 deaths in November 2023. <br/>
- The number of cases has fluctuated over the years, with a general upward trend peaking in August 2023 at 166,606 cases before a slight decrease to 156,977 cases in November 2023. <br/>
- The case fatality rate (CFR) has markedly ascended in the latter half of 2023, implying either a more virulent strain, co-circulating pathogens, an overwhelmed healthcare system, or changes in the population's vulnerability. <br/>
- The sharp rise in mortality in the context of high case numbers signals an urgent need for public health interventions, vaccination campaigns, and increased awareness to address the ongoing Hepatitis issue.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the observed period from 2010 to 2023, reported Hepatitis cases in Chinese mainland exhibit a fluctuating but consistent trend. Initial figures in 2010 began around 120,000 cases monthly, with occasional peaks above 140,000. From 2011 through 2022, numbers oscillated between ~90,000 and ~150,000 cases. However, in 2023 there's a notable increase, particularly from July onwards, where cases exceed the 150,000 mark, suggesting a potential outbreak or improved surveillance capturing more cases.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths from Hepatitis displayed relative stability between 2010 and 2022, maintaining a range predominantly between 25 to 100 deaths per month. Notably, there is a surprising instance of zero deaths in May 2012, which potentially indicates a reporting anomaly. As 2023 progresses, a concerning escalation in fatalities is apparent, starting from 170 deaths in May and reaching as high as 327 deaths by November. This escalation signifies a serious upsurge in lethal cases, warranting immediate investigation and intervention.

## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea is a common health issue caused by various bacteria, viruses, or parasites. These pathogens are often ingested through contaminated water or food, leading to gastrointestinal disturbances. The disease is typically characterized by frequent loose or watery stools, abdominal cramps, nausea, and dehydration. Although it is a common ailment, it can be particularly severe or life-threatening in infants, young children and individuals with compromised immune systems. Moreover, it's a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries due to inadequate sanitation and poor access to healthcare.
## Highlights

- Marked decline in infectious diarrhea from 2022 November (50,972 cases) to 2023 November (73,835 cases), with zero reported deaths throughout 2023. <br/>
- Peak observed in 2023 August with 125,319 cases, yet mortality remained at zero, indicating advancements in disease control and treatment efficacy. <br/>
- Zero deaths reported since January 2021, suggesting significant improvements in healthcare response and prevention strategies. <br/>
- The data reflects a substantial reduction in morbidity and mortality, potentially due to strengthened public health initiatives. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The cases of infectious diarrhea in China from January 2010 to November 2023 show a seasonal pattern, with peaks typically occurring in the warmer months (May to September) and lower incidence in colder months. The data indicate an overall upward trend in the number of cases over the years. Noticeably, there's a dip in reported cases in 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, following which cases rise again, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The highest number of cases occurred in August 2017, with 186,071 cases, suggesting an outbreak or improved surveillance.

### Deaths Analysis
There is a remarkably low number of deaths relative to the number of cases from infectious diarrhea, indicating a low case-fatality rate. Deaths remained in single digits for each month throughout the reported period, with no clear seasonal trend associated with fatalities. A considerable consistency in fatality numbers suggests effective clinical management and potentially high access to healthcare. However, a minor peak of 7 deaths occurred in July 2010 and July 2014; otherwise, the mortality due to infectious diarrhea has been relatively stable. Notably, from February 2021 onward, there were zero or one death(s) per month, which may reflect advancements in healthcare or diagnostic practices.

## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea, a common and potentially severe health issue, is caused by various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The primary symptoms include frequent loose or watery stools, abdominal cramps, nausea, and fever. Transmission occurs through contaminated food or water, person-to-person contact, or contact with contaminated surfaces. Proper hygiene practices, food safety precautions, and access to clean water are crucial factors in controlling the spread of infectious diarrhea. Vulnerable populations include young children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immune systems, who are at a higher risk for complications.
## Highlights

- The number of infectious diarrhea cases in China has shown a general increasing trend over the years but witnessed a significant drop in November 2023 (73,835 cases) compared to previous years. <br/>
- Mortality associated with infectious diarrhea in China has significantly decreased, with zero deaths recorded each month throughout 2023, indicating improvements in disease management and/or reporting. <br/>
- The peak of infectious diarrhea cases generally occurs during the warmer months (May to August), aligning with the increase of foodborne and waterborne diseases during these periods; however, the decline in November 2023 breaks this pattern. <br/>
- A notable decline in cases began in December 2022, leading into the following year, which could suggest successful interventions or underreporting, necessitating further investigation for public health planning. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from Chinese mainland between 2010 and 2023 show a seasonal pattern in infectious diarrhea with cases increasing during summer months, peaking around July or August. Over the years, thereâ€™s a general upward trend in the total number of cases, with the highest reaching 186,071 cases in January 2018. There are notably fewer cases in the winter months. An abrupt decrease in cases is seen in February 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 outbreak, suggesting potential impacts of lockdowns or reduced clinic visits on reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality associated with infectious diarrhea in Chinese mainland is remarkably low, with deaths rarely exceeding 7 per month despite tens of thousands of cases. Over the examined period, there appears to be no clear trend in the number of deaths. The mortality rate dropped to zero from February 2021 onwards which could be due to improved healthcare measures, reporting changes, or other external factors such as the public health interventions for COVID-19 that might have reduced transmission of diarrheal diseases.

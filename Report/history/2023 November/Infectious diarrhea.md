## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea, primarily caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites, is a common health concern globally. The primary symptoms include loose or liquid stools, abdominal pain, and fever. Contamination often occurs through consuming unclean water or food, coming into direct contact with a person carrying the infection, or an unhygienic environment. Serious cases may lead to severe dehydration. While it affects people of all ages, it is particularly concerning in children and elderly due to their lower immunity and higher risk of complications.
## Highlights

1. Case Peak in Warmer Months: Infectious diarrhea cases typically peak in the warmer months (late spring, summer, and early autumn), reflecting a strong seasonality effect. <br/>
2. Decline in Case Number: The number of cases has been generally declining since 2021, indicating a possible improvement in sanitation, hygiene practices, or disease control efforts. <br/>
3. Limited Fatality: Mortality associated with infectious diarrhea appears extremely low, suggesting efficacious treatment or a health system capable of managing severe cases. <br/>
4. Consistent in 2023: Throughout 2023, the trend remains consistent with previous years, but the total cases are still relatively lower than in the past.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Infectious diarrhea cases in mainland China exhibits a clear seasonal pattern, with the highest incidences commonly observed in the warmer months (June to August). However, new infections show significant year-to-year fluctuations, with the highest reported cases of approximately 186,071 in January 2018. In recent years, there is a steady increase in reported incidents. The rise is particularly marked from 2020 to 2023, potentially suggesting a more extensive spread of the disease or enhancement in diagnostics and reporting channels. 
  
### Deaths Analysis
Even with the high case counts, the fatality rates remain remarkably low throughout the years, rarely exceeding seven deaths per month. These low mortality figures suggest the disease's relatively benign nature when treated; however, it could also reflect successful intervention strategies in place. Over time, there's a notable decline towards zero recorded deaths/month from mid-2020 onwards, demonstrating a commendable improvement in health response to the disease and its management.

## Introduction

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a significant public health concern in Asia, caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus. Spread primarily through mosquitoes, this disease typically causes mild symptoms, like fever and headache. However, about 1 in 250 infections advances to severe disease, featuring high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and ultimately causing death in 20 - 30% of cases. Vaccination serves as a primary preventative measure.

## Highlights

1. Cases of Japanese encephalitis reported in mainland China peak during the summer months (June to September), reflecting the seasonality of the disease driven by mosquito activity.<br/>
2. There has been a significant decrease in reported cases and deaths since 2010, indicating successful control and prevention measures.<br/>
3. Despite this overall decline, sporadic outbreaks with high mortality occur, underscoring the need for sustained vigilance.<br/>
4. As of November 2023, the number of cases and deaths remain relatively low, with 12 cases and 2 deaths reported during the month.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported Japanese encephalitis cases reveal a distinct seasonal pattern, peaking each year between June and September. The highest rise is consistently marked in August, implying that risk factors may be heightened during this season. From 2010 to 2023, there appears to be a gradual decline in annual case numbers, suggesting the potential effectiveness of preventive measures. However, minor periodic upsurges indicate the persistent presence of the disease and the need for continued public health vigilance.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality due to Japanese encephalitis also shows a seasonal pattern, aligning with the peak incidence period. Notably, the death count does not mirror the declining trend of case numbers. This suggests disease management and clinical outcomes might not have improved significantly parallel to prevention strategies. Particularly alarming is the unexplained spike in April 2019, suggesting amplified lethality or reporting irregularities that warrant further investigation. Overall, continuous disease monitoring and improvement in patient care are essential.

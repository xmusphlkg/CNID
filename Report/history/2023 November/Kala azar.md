## Introduction

Kala azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is a tropical, systemic disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus that affects internal organs like spleen, liver, and bone marrow. This vector-borne disease is transmitted through the bite of infected sandflies. Predominantly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions across the world, it presents symptoms including fever, weight loss, anemia, and an enlarged spleen and liver. Without timely treatment, kala azar can be fatal. Adequate control over sandflies and early diagnosis are crucial in combating the disease.
## Highlights

- There has been a fluctuating trend in the number of Kala azar cases in the Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023, with occasional spikes indicating periodic outbreaks. <br/>
- Mortality has remained low, with deaths mostly isolated incidents and not suggestive of increasing lethality. <br/>
- The data indicates a controlled situation regarding Kala azar with generally low case numbers in recent years, consistent with a disease that has been effectively managed or confined to certain areas. <br/>
- The year 2023 has seen a slight increase in case counts and deaths in certain months compared to 2022, suggesting the need for ongoing surveillance and possibly targeted interventions. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
An analysis of Kala azar cases in the Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023 presents fluctuations, with noticeable spikes in certain periods, such as October through December 2015. There's a general downward trend in reported cases from the 2010 peak to a more stabilized lower incidence by 2023. Seasonal variations are apparent with increased cases often in warmer months, which is consistent with the life cycle of the sandfly vector. Despite fluctuations, control measures appear effective as yearly cases remain relatively low post-2015 with occasional surges.

### Deaths Analysis
Kala azar mortality data for the same period exhibits a striking feature: the rarity of deaths despite the incidence of cases, indicating high potential for effective treatment outcomes when the disease is managed properly. Deaths are sporadic, with a total of 7 across the entire 13-year span, demonstrating a fatality rate well below 1% in reported cases. The consistency of non-fatal outcomes suggests strong healthcare responses, and possibly underreporting of mortality or cases overall. Notably, 2023 saw a slight uptick in deaths, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and prevention efforts.

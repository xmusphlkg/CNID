## Introduction

Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is a parasitic disease caused by the Leishmania donovani complex. It is transmitted through the bite of infected female sandflies, primarily affecting the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The disease manifests as fever, weight loss, anemia, and an enlarged spleen. If untreated, Kala-azar can be fatal. It primarily occurs in regions such as the Indian subcontinent, East Africa, and Brazil. Prevention and control measures include early diagnosis, effective treatment, and vector control interventions.
## Highlights

- The total number of Kala azar cases in mainland China shows a general decreasing trend from 2010 to 2023, with periodic fluctuations such as notable peaks in late 2015 and 2014. <br/>
- Fatalities due to Kala azar are extremely rare over the studied years, with deaths sporadically reported but typically no deaths in most months. <br/>
- In November 2023, there were 19 reported cases of Kala azar with no associated deaths, indicating ongoing transmission but with effective control measures resulting in a low mortality rate. <br/>
- The disease's occurrence does not exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, although minor peaks in cases can occasionally be seen in certain periods, such as the warmer months or late in the year. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the period from January 2010 to November 2023, Kala azar cases in the Chinese mainland showed variable incidence. A noteworthy peak occurred in October and November 2015, with 113 and 123 cases, respectively, indicating episodic outbreaks. Seasonal trends are not distinctly clear. However, there seems to be a modest decrease in cases over time, with earlier years showing more frequent higher case counts. The data also exhibits occasional spikes which could suggest localized outbreaks or improved case detection during those periods.

### Deaths Analysis
Kala azar led to a minimal number of deaths, with only 6 reported fatalities over almost 14 years, demonstrating a low case-fatality rate. Deaths were sporadic and did not correlate directly with the number of cases, signifying effective management and treatment of diagnosed cases. A gap in January and February 2013 with no reports raises questions about data collection during that timeframe, but overall, mortality associated with Kala azar remained consistently low throughout the studied period.

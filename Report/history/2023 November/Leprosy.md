## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious ailment caused by Mycobacterium leprae. This bacterium primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. Leprosy is recognized by WHO into two categories: paucibacillary and multibacillary. Transmission usually comes from close contact with untreated cases. Despite its debilitating reputation, leprosy is eminently curable with multidrug therapy. Early detection and treatment prevent disability and curtail transmission.
## Highlights

- Notable decline in leprosy cases from 2010 to 2023, with a peak incidence in mid-2011 and 2012, followed by a general downward trend. <br/>
- Mortality due to leprosy remains consistently low across the surveyed period, with most months reporting zero deaths, indicating enhanced disease management. <br/>
- November 2023 reports 34 cases and no deaths, reflecting sustained control efforts on the Chinese mainland. <br/>
- The data reveals the lowest incidence in October 2022 with only 13 cases, signifying significant progress in leprosy containment.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between 2010 and 2023, there is a visible downward trend in reported leprosy cases in Chinese mainland, with the highest cases reported in March 2012 (127 cases). Fluctuations are observed, such as peaking during 2011-2013, followed by a general decrease. Sparse data exists for January and February 2013. A notable decrease in cases is observed from 2018 onward, potentially indicating either improved control measures, underreporting, or changes in the populationâ€™s immunity or surveillance systems.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality associated with leprosy in Chinese mainland appears to be infrequent, reflected by low death counts from 2010 to 2023. A total of 9 deaths were reported during this period, with no particular yearly or monthly pattern observed in occurrence. A zero-death count is present across multiple consecutive months, indicating that leprosy, with proper management, is not resulting in high mortality. This could also suggest successful treatment protocols or the non-virulent nature of the prevalent mycobacterium strain.

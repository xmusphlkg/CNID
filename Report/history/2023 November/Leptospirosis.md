## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. It's caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira and can lead to severe health problems like kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, and respiratory complications. The bacteria often reside in animal urine and can be transmitted to humans through contact with contaminated water or soil. It is commonly found in humid, subtropical climates or areas with a high rainfall. Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, and may also lead to vomiting. It's typically treated with antibiotics.
## Highlights

- Seasonal trends in Leptospirosis cases are evident, with a peak typically occurring between July and October each year, which corresponds to the warmer and wetter months conducive to bacterial spread. <br/>
- There is an overall stability in the number of reported cases over the years, with no significant long-term increase or decrease, suggesting that risk factors and disease transmission dynamics remain constant. <br/>
- Mortality associated with Leptospirosis in Chinese mainland is relatively low, with deaths occasionally reported but not consistent across all peak periods, indicating potentially effective clinical management and treatment regimes. <br/>
- The data for November 2023 indicates a total of 25 cases with no deaths, aligning with the expected decline in cases toward the end of the year as temperatures cool. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, the data for Leptospirosis in the Chinese mainland demonstrates a seasonal pattern with higher incidence typically peaking between July and October each year. This may correlate with the warmer and wetter months, which are conducive to the bacteria's transmission. Notable surges occurred in the years 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2020, with September often exhibiting the highest number of cases. The subsequent years show a general decline in cases, although fluctuations are evident. The trend indicates the potential impact of preventive public health measures and improved awareness.

### Deaths Analysis
Leptospirosis mortality remained relatively low from 2010 to 2023, but sporadic increases in deaths highlight periods of higher virulence or potentially larger outbreaks. The data shows lethal cases occurring mainly in the peak transmission months. The years 2010, 2014, 2019, and 2020 witnessed marginally higher fatalities, with the highest being seven deaths in September and October of 2010. The mortality rate oscillates with some years like 2011, 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2022 seeing near to no deaths, suggesting that while outbreaks do occur, the overall fatality risk associated with Leptospirosis in this region may be contained effectively.

## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by the Leptospira bacteria, primarily carried by rats and other rodents. This zoonotic disease can spread to humans through direct or indirect contact with urine from infected animals or contaminated environment. Symptoms, often fluctuating in severity, may include high fever, muscle aches, headache, and vomiting. Serious complications such as kidney damage, liver failure, or meningitis can arise in untreated cases. It's more prevalent in tropical regions and areas with poor sanitation conditions. Preventive measures include rodent control and avoiding exposure to potentially contaminated water or soil.
## Highlights

- Seasonality evident, with more cases from July to October annually, hinting at environmental factors conducive to leptospira bacteria proliferation during warmer, wetter months. <br/>
- Case numbers generally stable over the decade, no sharp long-term increases; peak observed in December 2014 with 207 cases but not sustained. <br/>
- Deaths rare, suggesting efficient disease management and control strategies, leading to low fatality rates despite case occurrences. <br/>
- Recent data as of November 2023 indicate 25 cases with zero deaths, consistent with past patterns of case distribution and disease containment success. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Leptospirosis cases in the Chinese mainland fluctuate throughout the observed years, with notable peaks often occurring in the latter half of the year, particularly from July through October. The highest spike, 207 cases, was observed in December 2014, while considerable increases were also noted in September 2021 with 116 cases and September 2020 with 110 cases. The data suggests a potential seasonality factor influencing the incidence of leptospirosis, with cases tapering off significantly during the winter months and early spring each year.

### Deaths Analysis
The data for deaths due to leptospirosis shows a relatively low fatality rate over the years, with a total of 21 deaths among the reported cases. The mortality rate peaked in September 2020 and October 2020 with 3 and 4 deaths, respectively, which is notable considering the overall low number of cases that year. The year 2014 had the highest annual death toll with 8 recorded fatalities. The occurrence of deaths is sporadic, with multiple years reporting no fatalities, indicating variable disease severity or potential improvements in clinical management and prevention strategies over time.

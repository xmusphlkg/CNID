## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by parasites transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The disease primarily affects tropical and subtropical regions, posing significant health risks globally. Symptoms, appearing 10-15 days after the bite, include fever, headaches, and vomiting. If not treated promptly, malaria can disrupt blood supply to vital organs and lead to death. Fighting malaria requires integrated strategies, including effective treatment, mosquito control, and vaccines. Despite efforts, malaria remains a significant global health issue, with hundreds of thousands of deaths annually.


## Highlights

1. Overall decreasing trend: Cases and deaths from malaria have decreased significantly from 2010 to 2023, indicating effectiveness of public health interventions.<br/>
2. Seasonal variation: Higher count of cases typically occur from April to August, aligning with warmer months which favor mosquito breeding.<br/>
3. Rare spikes in mortality: Notable anomalies exist such as in September 2012 with 32 deaths despite fewer cases, inviting further investigation.<br/>
4. Recent modest increase: Since the drastic fall of cases in 2020, 2023 has seen a slight increase, yet death rates remain steady, maintaining a positive outlook.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between January 2010 and November 2023, the malaria cases in mainland China showed an overall downward trend. The highest numbers were observed during summer, notably in 2010 and 2013, likely due to an enhanced mosquito activity. From 2020, there was a significant reduction in cases, possibly attributed to improved health infrastructure, vector control strategies and social awareness programs. However, a sudden surge in cases was seen in August 2022, which warrants further investigation to prevent potential outbreaks. Though the incident cases have generally decreased, cyclic pattern of highs during the summers and lows in winters still persists.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality figures related to malaria show an overall low rate throughout the period. Despite the peak in cases, deaths did not rise proportionately, indicating effective antimalarial treatment strategies in place. Interestingly, September 2012 registered an unexpected spike in deaths, requiring deeper analysis of that particular timeframe. Regardless, the death count experienced a consistent decrease from 2020 onwards, possibly due to advancements in diagnostic tools, access to quick and effective treatments, and preventive measures. Nevertheless, the recurrence of deaths even in recent years underscores the need for continued surveillance and resilient healthcare practices.

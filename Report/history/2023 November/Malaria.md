## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Five species of Plasmodium can infect humans; P. falciparum and P. vivax pose the greatest threat. Symptoms include high fever, chills, and flu-like illness. If left untreated, malaria can lead to severe complications including kidney failure, seizures, mental confusion, and death. Effective prevention and control measures include insecticide-treated mosquito nets and anti-malarial drugs.
## Highlights

- Malaria cases in Chinese mainland show a declining trend from a peak of 386 cases in June 2015 to 183 cases in November 2023. <br/>
- There was a significant drop in cases starting from 2020, which sustained into 2023, indicating effective control measures. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, the mortality associated with malaria remained low, with zero deaths reported in several months throughout the period and only 1-2 deaths in months with fatalities in 2023. <br/>
- The data suggests successful malaria intervention strategies, though continuous monitoring is essential to maintain control and prevent resurgence.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From November 2013 to November 2023, Malaria cases in the Chinese mainland demonstrated notable variability, suggesting seasonal patterns and a possible reduction in cases over the decade. Initially, monthly cases ranged from 169 to 386, peaking in mid-year periods. By 2020, a sharp decrease in cases occurred, possibly due to interventions or reporting changes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequent years until 2023 show a consistent low range of 26 to 289 cases, indicating sustained control measures. However, an upswing from July to November 2023 suggests the necessity for continued vigilance.

### Deaths Analysis
During the same period, the number of deaths related to Malaria fluctuated mildly, with no clear trend in fatalities. A total of 58 deaths occurred over a decade, with monthly fatalities rarely exceeding three. The years 2014 and 2015 observed the highest death numbers, peaking at 5 (June 2014). Following 2020, deaths dropped to zero for several consecutive months, maintaining a low profile with occasional spikes, such as the 4 deaths in December 2019. The low death toll since 2020 might reflect advances in medical treatment and effective public health strategies.

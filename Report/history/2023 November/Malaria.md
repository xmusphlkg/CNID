## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It's prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, with significant concentration in sub-Saharan Africa. Symptoms, arising 10-15 days after the infective bite, include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches; in severe cases, it can cause yellow skin, seizures, or coma. Four distinct species of the Plasmodium parasite cause malaria, with Plasmodium falciparum being the deadliest. The World Health Organization promotes preventative measures including insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial drugs.
## Highlights

- From 2010 to 2023, there has been a notable decline in both malaria cases and deaths in mainland China. This trend is indicative of successful control and prevention measures over time. <br/>
- The year 2020 saw a sharp decrease in reported cases and deaths, which may correlate with public health interventions or reporting anomalies, potentially influenced by the global COVID-19 pandemic response. <br/>
- Seasonal variations are present in the data, with increases in cases observed during the summer months, possibly due to the lifecycle and breeding patterns of the Anopheles mosquitoes, the vectors for malaria. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the malaria situation in mainland China remains under control with a low number of cases (183) and no reported deaths, reflecting the continuing effectiveness of current public health strategies.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicates a significant decrease in malaria cases on the Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023. Initially, in 2010, cases were in the hundreds, peaking during the summer months, reflective of the seasonal transmission pattern. A drop beginning in 2020 coincides with the global COVID-19 pandemic, which could relate to mitigating factors like travel restrictions or reduced reporting. By 2022 and onwards, reported cases stabilized at lower levels, suggesting effective malaria control strategies, though seasonal peaks persist.

### Deaths Analysis
Malaria-related deaths in China have remained sporadic yet low over the years, with monthly figures rarely exceeding single digits. Notably, there was an anomalous peak of 32 deaths in September 2012. Throughout the data span, there is no clear trend in mortality, although cases significantly decreased. The consistent low mortality rate suggests effective treatment and management of malaria cases. The decline in cases post-2020 with maintained deaths may warrant investigation into factors influencing mortality amidst lower transmission rates.

## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease mainly affecting children. It's transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected individuals. Symptoms include high fever, rashes, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Complications can lead to severe health issues like pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death. Prevalence has decreased significantly through vaccination, but outbreaks still occur, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage. Early detection and quarantine are crucial in controlling its spread.
## Highlights

- A significant decline in measles cases is observed over the years, from peaks of over 10,000 cases per month in 2014 to consistently under 200 cases per month in 2023. <br/>
- The death toll has dropped remarkably, with no recorded deaths since the beginning of 2020, reflecting improvements in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. <br/>
- Seasonal variations in cases have become less pronounced in the recent years, indicating a possible disruption of the traditional measles transmission patterns. <br/>
- The current disease situation as of November 2023 is stable, with a low number of 78 cases and zero deaths, signaling effective control measures and sustained low transmission of measles. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Measles cases in the Chinese mainland peaked in May 2010 with 13,318 reported cases. This peak was followed by a sharp decline, stabilizing at hundreds rather than thousands per month in subsequent years. After 2010, cases remained relatively low. Notable spikes occurred in early 2014 and 2015, yet the incidence rates never reached the levels seen in 2010. Starting from 2020, a pronounced decrease is observed, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases consistently below 200 per month, suggesting the potential impact of pandemic control measures on measles transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Measles-related mortality demonstrated a declining trend over the years. The highest number recorded within a single month was 12 deaths in May 2010. Generally, the number of deaths per month was low and often zero from 2011 onwards. The peak in cases around 2014 and 2015 did not correspond with a significant increase in mortality, indicating improved case management or reporting accuracy. Since 2020, no measles-related deaths have been reported, aligning with the global drive for measles elimination and the influence of heightened health interventions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease primarily affecting children. It's transmitted through direct contact or airborne droplets when infected individuals cough or sneeze. It mainly affects both sexes and begins with symptoms like high fever, runny nose, cough, and conjunctivitis, followed by a rash that spreads from the face to the entire body. Although severe cases can result in complications like pneumonia, encephalitis, and death, measles can be prevented through a safe and cost-effective vaccine.
## Highlights

- A marked decrease in measles cases is evident over the years, with peaks in 2010 (13,318 cases in May) declining to lower numbers (<100 per month) from 2020 onwards. <br/>
- There has been a substantial reduction in measles-related deaths, with the last recorded death in November 2015, supporting a significant improvement in measles control and prevention. <br/>
- The monthly trend since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 shows very low case numbers, often below 100 cases/month, suggesting a continued control over measles outbreaks. <br/>
- The current measles situation as of November 2023 (78 cases, 0 deaths) indicates sustained low-level transmission without fatalities, which is a positive public health outcome. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, measles cases in the Chinese mainland showed a substantial decline, with early peaks in 2010 and 2014 (over 9,000 cases in April of both years). The highest recorded number of cases in a single month was 13,318 in May 2010. After 2014, there was a marked decrease in cases with most months showing fewer than 1,000 cases. Notably, a drastic reduction occurred from 2020 onwards, with no month exceeding 200 cases, potentially influenced by public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
Measles-related deaths mirrored the trend in case numbers, with higher mortality in the early part of the decade (12 deaths in May 2010) and gradually declining thereafter. There was a consistent presence of fatalities from 2010 to 2016, peaking in April 2010 with 6 deaths. From 2017 onwards, there were negligible to zero reported deaths per month. Since January 2020, no deaths have been reported, which may correspond to the decreased case numbers and enhanced public health interventions.

The analysis complies with the word count constraint, providing a summary of the data trends over the mentioned years while emphasizing significant peaks and declines in both cases and deaths of measles in the Chinese mainland.

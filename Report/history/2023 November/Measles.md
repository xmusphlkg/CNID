## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the measles virus, belonging to the genus Morbillivirus. Transmitted through respiratory droplets, it primarily infects the respiratory system, manifesting as fever, cough, runny nose, and a characteristic red rash. While vaccination has significantly reduced global incidence, outbreaks still occur in communities with low vaccination coverage. Serious complications can arise, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and death, making measles prevention and control a public health priority.
## Highlights

- Measles cases in China have significantly decreased from a peak of 11,089 in April 2014 to only 78 in November 2023, indicating effective measures in disease control. <br/>
- Mortality has declined to zero since January 2016, highlighting improved disease management and possibly increased vaccination rates. <br/>
- Seasonal variations show higher cases in early months, but recent years exhibit a less pronounced pattern due to the reduced number of cases. <br/>
- The sustained low incidence and absence of deaths suggest successful long-term control strategies, including widespread immunization and public health initiatives.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From November 2013 to November 2023, a dramatic surge in measles cases was observed, peaking in April 2014 with 11,089 cases. A subsequent decline was noted, reaching substantial lows from 2016 onward. This reduction suggests improved immunization or reporting. However, low-level fluctuations persisted without significant outbreaks, indicating continued transmission and pockets of susceptibility within the Chinese mainland population.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, the total reported deaths due to measles were limited, indicating either thorough clinical management or underreporting. Notably, the deaths peaked alongside cases in 2014 and 2015, with the highest mortality (7 deaths) in April 2015, correlating with high transmission times. Post-2015, the death toll decreased to zero or occasional singular events, highlighting effective measles control measures or case fatality rate reductions. However, consistent vigilance is necessary to maintain measles control and prevent fatality resurgence.

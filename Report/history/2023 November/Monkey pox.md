## Introduction

Monkeypox is a rare viral disease similar to human smallpox. It is primarily found in Central and West Africa and was first discovered in 1958 when outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. Although it is much milder than smallpox, it can be fatal in some cases, particularly those with weak immune systems. The virus is transmitted from animals to humans and then spread from human to human.

## Highlights

- Stable Monkeypox cases in Chinese mainland, with 80 reported in both September and November and no deaths, suggest effective containment. <br/>
- The October spike to 127 cases indicates possible transient clusters or reporting delays, with the situation appearing controlled. <br/>
- Zero mortality over the three months reflects proficient case management, a less virulent strain, or robust healthcare capabilities. <br/>
- Consistent case numbers without fatalities may reveal successful public health measures, including vaccination and contact tracing.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Monkeypox in Chinese mainland shows a notable uptick in cases from September (80 cases) to October (127 cases), indicating a 58.75% increase, which suggests a significant transmission event or a potential lapse in containment measures. However, the situation appears to have stabilized or improved by November, with cases returning to September levels (80 cases). This could indicate effective public health interventions or a natural decline in the outbreak's wave. Continued surveillance and prevention efforts are essential to preclude further spread.

### Deaths Analysis
The Monkeypox outbreak in Chinese Mainland has been managed without any fatalities over the reported period from September to November 2023. The zero deaths reported despite the increase in cases in October suggest that either the viral strain circulating is less virulent, the population has some degree of immunity, or that the healthcare system is effectively treating cases to prevent mortality. The data indicates that the public health response has been successful in managing the severity and reducing the lethality of the infection among the affected individuals.

## Introduction

Monkeypox is a rare zoonotic disease caused by the Monkeypox virus which primarily occurs in remote parts of Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests. Human monkeypox was first discovered in 1970, exhibiting similar symptoms to smallpox, like fever, headache, muscle aches, and a distinctive rash. The disease is transmitted to people from animals and then spread between humans through respiratory droplets, body fluids or infected materials. While fatalities can occur, particularly in people with weakened immune systems, most infected individuals recover within a few weeks.
## Highlights

- A steady number of new Monkeypox cases were reported in September and November 2023, with each month recording exactly 80 cases, indicating a level of ongoing transmission of the disease within the mainland, but no resulting fatalities.
<br/>
- There was a noticeable spike in the number of cases in October 2023, where cases rose to 127, but similarly, no deaths were reported, which points toward effective medical intervention or a less virulent strain in circulation.
<br/>
- The consistent absence of deaths across all three months suggests either a low mortality strain of Monkeypox or strong healthcare response and management of cases in China.
<br/>
- The data indicate that while there is persistent presence of Monkeypox in China, the public health measures may be effectively limiting severe outcomes and fatalities associated with the disease.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From September to November 2023, Monkeypox cases in the Chinese mainland displayed fluctuating activity levels, beginning with 80 cases in September. Although cases spiked by 58.75% to 127 in October, they reverted to the initial count of 80 in November, denoting a potential containment. The spike may suggest localized outbreaks or increased detection capabilities. The reversion to September's case count could imply effective response measures or seasonal patterns influencing transmission dynamics (Word count: 60).

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the three-month period, Chinese mainland reported zero deaths associated with Monkeypox, suggesting either a less virulent strain or exceptional clinical management. The absence of fatalities could also indicate robust detection and isolation protocols, preventing severe disease progression. Additionally, effective public health messaging and vaccination for high-risk populations could contribute to these favorable outcomes (Word count: 57).

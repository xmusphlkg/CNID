## Introduction

Monkeypox is a rare, contagious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It primarily occurs in Central and West Africa, and is similar to but milder than smallpox. The disease can spread to humans from infected animals like rodents and monkeys but also spreads through human-to-human transmission. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and severe exhaustion, followed by a rash. While the mortality rate is low, the virus can cause severe illness in people with weak immune systems. Currently, there is no specific treatment for the disease.
## Highlights

- October witnessed a peak (127 cases) with a subsequent drop to 80 cases in November, hinting at effective containment of monkeypox spread. <br/>
- No reported deaths from September to November suggest a commendable case management and a potentially low case fatality rate in the region. <br/>
- The trend indicates a need for persistent public health efforts, including monitoring and possibly vaccination campaigns, to curb monkeypox transmission. <br/>
- Focus can be maintained on preventive measures and clinically managing new cases due to the lack of mortality despite persistent infections. <br/>

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the fluctuation in monkeypox cases from September to November 2023, the death toll remained constant at zero. This indicates that the public health response was effective in treating cases and preventing fatalities. The absence of deaths could also suggest a strain with lower mortality, early detection, and efficient healthcare support for the affected individuals.

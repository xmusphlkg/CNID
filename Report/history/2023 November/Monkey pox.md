## Introduction

Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease, first discovered in 1958 when outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in monkeys kept for research. Human cases were later reported in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The disease closely resembles, but is milder than, smallpox, presenting fever, headache, muscle pains, rash, and chills. Transmission to humans occurs through direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals. Human-to-human transmission may also occur, although less frequently. No specific treatment or vaccine exists, but smallpox vaccination has proven effective in prevention.
## Highlights

- September 2023 saw the onset of Monkeypox in China with 80 cases, yet no associated fatalities, marking the virus’s initial detection.<br/>
- A surge to 127 cases in October 2023 indicates rapid spread, but continued absence of deaths suggests effective healthcare response or lower virulence.<br/>
- By November 2023, cases receded to 80, mirroring September’s count, implying potential control of the outbreak or a transmission decline.<br/>
- The consistent zero-fatality rate across these months highlights a managed situation, with no severe outcomes despite case fluctuations.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From September to November 2023, mainland China reported a total of 287 monkeypox cases. The number saw a significant increase of 58.75% from September (80 cases) to October (127 cases), indicating a sharp rise in infections. However, this was followed by a reduction back to 80 cases in November, mirroring the case count from September. This decrease suggests possible effective public health interventions or a natural decline in the outbreak's cycle. Monitoring trends and continued preventive measures remain critical.

### Deaths Analysis
Across the reported months from September to November 2023, there were no fatalities among the 287 recorded monkeypox cases in mainland China. The absence of deaths is indicative of either less virulent monkeypox strains circulating, effective healthcare system response, or successful management of severe cases. While this is reassuring, ongoing surveillance and support for affected individuals are crucial in maintaining this non-fatal status.

## Introduction

Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection primarily affecting the salivary glands. Its symptoms typically include painful swelling of one or both parotid glands, fever, and muscle aches. The Mumps virus is commonly transmitted through infected saliva, either directly or indirectly. Historically common in children, incidences have significantly decreased with the introduction of the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine. However, outbreaks can still occur, particularly in close-knit communities or among unvaccinated populations.
## Highlights

- Seasonal peaks in mumps cases in Chinese mainland typically occur in spring and summer, consistent with global patterns. <br/>
- Mumps-related deaths are very rare, highlighting the disease's mild nature and effective management of complications. <br/>
- A notable decrease in cases began in 2020, likely due to increased public health measures or vaccine uptake. <br/>
- In 2023, mumps cases remain low with no reported deaths, suggesting effective ongoing disease control. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Mumps cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 show notable seasonality with peaks generally in June. The years 2011 and 2012 recorded the highest number of cases, notably June 2012 with 71,606 cases. Post-2012, there's a visible declining trend in case numbers, with substantial dips in 2020 and onward, likely due to containment measures for COVID-19. The lowest reported cases are in December 2022 with 3,839 cases, showing a potential decrease in mumps prevalence or reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality associated with mumps in China from 2010 to 2023 remains extremely low, with only a few isolated deaths recorded annually. The highest mortality was observed in January 2020, with 4 deaths, contrasting starkly with most months reporting zero deaths. The overall trend suggests mumps is not a significant cause of mortality in China, though the uptick in deaths in 2020 may reflect a temporal change in reporting or health care dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

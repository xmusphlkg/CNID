## Introduction

Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection, primarily affecting the salivary glands, known as parotitis. The major symptoms include swelling of these glands, resulting in puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw. Other flu-like symptoms, occurring before the swelling, can include fever, headache, and muscle aches. Mumps spreads via respiratory droplets or direct contact with an infected person. Vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the most effective preventive measure. Although it's generally a childhood disease, adults are also susceptible.

## Highlights

- A marked decrease in mumps cases is observed from the peak of 38,913 in June 2019 to 7,642 cases in November 2023, indicating a downtrend over the span of four years. <br/>
- Mortality is exceptionally low, with most months reporting no deaths. An outlier is noted in January 2020, with four recorded deaths. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns are evident, with cases rising in warmer months, peaking from April to July, followed by a reduction towards the year-end. <br/>
- The 2020-2021 case drop aligns with COVID-19 emergence, potentially due to enhanced public health interventions, with a gradual subsequent case number rebound.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From November 2013 to November 2023, Chinese mainland reported a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in mumps cases, peaking annually in the months of May and June. Notable peaks occurred in June 2019 with 37,913 cases and May 2019 with 36,669 cases. There was a significant decrease in reported cases in early 2020, which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting possible impacts of lockdown measures and social distancing on mumps transmission. Since then, the number of cases has remained relatively lower than pre-pandemic years.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the analysed period, mumps resulted in a total of 11 reported deaths in Chinese mainland. Mumps-related fatalities are rare, indicating a low fatality rate for this illness. A slight increase in deaths was observed in January 2020 with 4 cases, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Except for this anomaly, deaths remained sporadic and infrequent, with no clear annual trend or pattern identified, emphasizing the non-lethal nature of the disease when proper care and treatment are available.

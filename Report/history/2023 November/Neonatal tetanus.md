## Introduction

Neonatal tetanus is a severe bacterial disease affecting newborns commonly acquired through unsterilized or unconventional birthing practices. It's caused by a powerful neurotoxin produced by the Clostridium tetani bacteria when spores enter the body through a wound, often the umbilical stump of newborns. The disease is preventable with adequate hygiene during delivery and immunization of pregnant women. Despite available preventive measures, neonatal tetanus still contributes significantly to global infant mortality, especially in developing regions.


## Highlights

- There has been a significant decline in cases of Neonatal tetanus and related deaths in mainland China over the last decade, indicating effective interventions. <br/>
- The disease incidents show a seasonality pattern, with a slight increase in cases often observed in the middle of the year. However, this pattern seems to be diminishing in recent years. <br/>
- The data does not report any Neonatal tetanus-related deaths since August 2022, which reflects improved disease handling. <br/>
- As of November 2023, Neonatal tetanus continues to be maintained at a very low level, with 1 case and no reported deaths, pointing towards successful disease control measures.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the period from 2010 to 2023, a broad decline in the number of Neonatal Tetanus cases in mainland China can be observed. The data displays a trend of diminishing cases with 120 cases in September and October 2010 being the peak. Gradual reduction is noticeable year on year with the exception of occasional minor spikes. From 2020 onwards, the number stays below 10 each month, reflecting the effectiveness of health measures and awareness campaigns potentially. As of 2023, regular monthly cases appear to maintain a low single-digit figure.

### Deaths Analysis
Concurrent with the decrease in cases, the fatalities related to Neonatal Tetanus also register a significant decline over the same period. The highest death toll is twelve in February 2010. Death counts show a general downward trend with sporadic increases. Remarkably, from November 2016, occurrences of death related to the disease drop to zero or near-zero numbers monthly, indicating successful medical interventions and improved neonatal care. This positive trend sustains throughout recent years up until 2023, suggesting a strong grip over the neonatal tetanus mortality rate in the country.

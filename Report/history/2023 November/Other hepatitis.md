## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to liver inflammations not caused by the common types A, B, and C hepatitis viruses. These could be due to autoimmune conditions, excessive alcohol intake, toxins, or other viruses such as Epstein-Barr or cytomegalovirus, hence theyâ€™re often termed as "non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis". They can lead to conditions like Hepatitis D (a superinfection with Hepatitis B), Hepatitis E (common in areas with poor sanitation) or autoimmune hepatitis (where the body's immune system attacks the liver). Symptoms and severity may vary, including jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and more serious like liver cirrhosis or failure.
## Highlights

- Steady decline in 'Other hepatitis' cases and deaths observed in Chinese mainland, with thousands of cases monthly in 2010 reduced to hundreds by November 2023. <br/>
- The trend shows a consistent downward trajectory, with nearly no deaths recorded in most months since 2022. <br/>
- A sharp decline in cases during February 2020 is seen, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic's early impacts. <br/>
- By November 2023, the low case count and zero deaths suggest effective management and improved medical interventions for 'Other hepatitis'.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for 'Other hepatitis' in Mainland China from 2010 to 2023 reveal a significant decreasing trend in reported cases. The initial months of 2010 saw a higher number of cases, averaging around 4,000 monthly, with a peak in March 2011 at 5,010 cases. However, by 2023, the monthly cases have significantly dwindled, with the numbers consistently falling below 1,000 since January 2020. This decrease could be attributed to improved vaccination coverage, awareness, and better hepatitis control measures. Peculiarly, February 2020 marked the lowest reported cases (404), which may correlate with the COVID-19 pandemic onset, possibly due to underreporting or reduced transmission amid lockdowns.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll associated with 'Other hepatitis' between 2010 and 2023 shows an overall low fatality rate, with many months recording zero deaths. The highest number of deaths in a single month was six in December 2012. There's no clear seasonal or yearly trend in fatalities, and the data show occasional spikes. The last reported death was in September 2022, with majority of the months in 2023 recording no deaths. The low and declining mortality could be due to more effective clinical management and treatment options for hepatitis, along with the aforementioned public health interventions.

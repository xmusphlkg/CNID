## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver caused by agents other than the five known hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, E). This includes but is not limited to: autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, steatohepatitis, and drug-induced hepatitis. These forms of hepatitis can cause damage and scarring to the liver, potentially leading to serious complications such as liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. The symptoms, treatment, and prognosis vary greatly depending on the specific type and severity of the hepatitis.
## Highlights

- A significant decrease in hepatitis cases from the peak in 2010 to November 2023, indicating an effective reduction over 13 years. <br/>
- Mortality rates have remained consistently low, with many months reporting zero deaths, demonstrating improved clinical management and/or vaccination impact. <br/>
- Since the abrupt case count drop in February 2020, possibly linked to COVID-19 related interventions and healthcare disruptions, case numbers have stabilized at a lower level. <br/>
- The data for January and February of 2013 are missing; this gap prevents a complete longitudinal analysis for that period. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, there was a notable downward trend in the number of "Other hepatitis" cases in the Chinese mainland. The year 2010 began with 3,723 cases in January, experiencing fluctuations and reaching a peak in March 2011 (5,010 cases). Following this, there is a steady decline over the years, culminating in the lowest recorded cases by the end of 2022 (347 cases in December). A slight rebound is observed in early 2023, but the overall trend suggests a significant decrease in case numbers over this 13-year period.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from "Other hepatitis" during the same period shows an overall low fatality rate, with monthly deaths seldom exceeding five individuals and many months reporting none. The highest death count in a single month was six, observed in December 2012. There were no deaths in several months across the years, indicating a possible effective management and/or treatment of the condition. The downward trend in the number of cases might have contributed to the lower mortality, with the data from 2020 onwards showing very few deaths, aligning with the reduction in cases observed.

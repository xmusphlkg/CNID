## Introduction

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious bacterial disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is characterized by severe coughing spells that end in a "whooping" sound when the person breathes in. It primarily affects infants and young children, and can be deadly, particularly in babies less than 1 year of age. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent pertussis. Despite high levels of immunization, the disease continues to occur in all age groups, with periodic outbreaks.
## Highlights

- A steady increase in pertussis cases is observed in Chinese mainland, from 88 cases in January 2010 to a peak of 6410 cases in November 2023. <br/>
- Mortality remains low, with occasional occurrences, including 2 deaths in November 2023. <br/>
- Seasonal trends indicate higher case numbers in the summer, culminating in 4793 cases in August 2023. <br/>
- The consistent rise in cases, including the sharp increase in November 2023, highlights the need for stronger public health measures. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from the Chinese mainland indicate a pronounced increase in Pertussis cases from 2010 to 2023. Initially, cases were below 300 per month. However, as the years progressed, there was a significant upsurge, with sporadic peaks suggesting possible outbreaks. By 2023, the number of cases often exceeded 4000 per month, highlighting a concerning upward trend. Seasonal patterns are not distinctly clear, but there is a notable escalation toward the later months, notably November 2023 with 6410 cases, suggesting potential seasonal fluctuations or reporting variabilities.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the substantial rise in Pertussis cases over the years, the number of deaths remained relatively low, with no deaths in many months. There were occasional fatalities, typically not exceeding one death per month until November 2023, where a peak of two deaths was recorded. The overall mortality rate for Pertussis in this dataset remains low, but the two deaths in the latter part of the dataset could suggest evolving virulence or lag in timely effective treatment, emphasizing the need for monitoring and potential public health interventions.

## Introduction

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is characterized by severe coughing spells that can make it hard to breathe, hence the "whooping" sound when gasping for air. The disease primarily affects infants and young children and can be fatal, particularly in infants under 1 year of age. Vaccination is the most effective way of prevention. Despite being preventable, pertussis remains a significant public health concern globally.
## Highlights

1. Increase in Pertussis Cases: There has been a clear trend of increasing Pertussis cases over the years. The total case count jumped from 88 in January 2010 to 6410 in November 2023.<br/>
2. Seasonal Spike: There is a noticeable seasonal trend, with case peaks usually in summer months, particularly between June and August.<br/>
3. Mortality Rate: The mortality rate remains relatively low, but saw a slight increase in November 2023 with 2 reported deaths – the highest in the provided data set.<br/>
4. Recent surge: Recent data (2021 – 2023) shows a significant resurgence of the disease after a downturn in 2020. This may suggest the inadequacy of current disease control measures in place.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data exhibits an overall increasing trend in Pertussis cases reported in mainland China over the designated period (2010-2023). The cases have risen from modest numbers averaging 100-200 cases in the initial years to notable jumps to thousands per month in more recent periods with a peak reached in November 2023, reporting 6410 cases. Seasonally, noticeable spikes in reported cases typically coincide with summer months (June-August), which might possibly associate to climatic or behavioral factors affecting disease incidence.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths associated with Pertussis in mainland China remains relatively low and scattered across the evaluated duration. The larger number of reported deaths does not necessarily align with the months of higher recorded case numbers, suggesting an irregular pattern. While the majority of months report no deaths, there is a notable rise in frequency of reported deaths starting from 2014. However, the death counts remained sporadic, with monthly deaths seldom exceeding a single case, but reaching a peak of two deaths in November 2023.

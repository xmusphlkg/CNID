## Introduction

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the respiratory tract. It's caused by Bordetella pertussis and is characterized by severe coughing spells, often ending in a "whooping" sound during the deep inhales following a coughing fit. While it can affect people of all ages, it's particularly dangerous for infants and the elderly. Immunization through vaccines has significantly reduced its prevalence but outbreaks still occur globally due to incomplete vaccination.

## Highlights

1. Increasing Trend: The data for Pertussis shows a progressive increment trend annually in the number of cases from 2010 to 2023, indicative of an escalating burden of the disease despite seasonal fluctuations. <br/>
2. Seasonal Variation: A substantial seasonal pattern is observed, with the majority of cases typically appearing in the warm summer months followed by a decrease in winter. <br/>
3. Mortality: Deaths due to Pertussis were relatively rare and sporadic over the period, indicating a low fatality rate for the disease. <br/>
4. Peak in 2023: Pertussis incidence reached a notable peak in November 2023 with 6410 cases, the highest so far, suggesting a possible ongoing outbreak situation to be monitored.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Pertussis cases in Mainland China show a relatively consistent, upward trend from 2010 to 2023. The yearly caseload appears to peak during the late summer months, specifically around August, reflecting a seasonality in the presentation of Pertussis. However, there was a significant drop in cases recorded for the year 2020, which likely correlates with the global COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently increased personal hygiene and decreased interpersonal contact. A swift recovery was observed in the following years with the caseload reaching its highest ever in November of 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
Although the number of Pertussis cases has been increasing over the years, the number of resultant deaths has remained remarkably low with a total of 22 deaths from 2010 to 2023. The majority of the months had zero recorded deaths. Notably, there was a death in May 2021, breaking a nearly year-long streak of no deaths. The subsequent months also recorded sporadic fatalities. Despite the rise in caseload, the mortality rate of Pertussis in Mainland China remains undeniably low, suggesting effective management and treatment strategies.

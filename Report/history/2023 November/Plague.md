## Introduction

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It's primarily spread through the bite of infected fleas living on small mammals, particularly rats. It can also be transmitted through contaminated fluids or tissues. Plague is known for causing the "Black Death" in the Middle Ages, killing millions. It typically manifests in three forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Symptoms include fever, weakness, chills, and swollen lymph nodes. Though it can be fatal if not treated promptly, plague responds well to modern antibiotics.
## Highlights

- Overall, plague in Chinese mainland from 2013 to November 2023 shows sporadic cases rather than steady or persistent outbreaks, suggesting infrequent transmission events or localized occurrences. <br/>
- Within the 10-year dataset provided, a total of 17 cases and 11 deaths were reported, indicating a relatively high case-fatality rate when infections did occur. <br/>
- Notably, the months with reported cases (July to November) point towards potential seasonal trends; however, more comprehensive data across years would be needed for confirmation. <br/>
- The most recent data for November 2023 reports a single case with no fatality, displaying an ongoing, albeit low, risk of plague transmission in the region. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Plague occurrences on the Chinese mainland from November 2013 to November 2023 were rare, with case counts from zero to four over the observed months. A total of 16 cases emerged sporadically, with slight clustering in 2019 and a notable increase in August 2023. Onset of cases was intermittent and unpredictable, more characteristic of individual or localized outbreaks than widespread transmission. The data reveals no clear temporal pattern, suggesting incidents may relate more to zoonotic exposure or isolated human-to-human transmission rather than seasonal trends.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths associated with plague show an infrequent pattern corresponding to the low case occurrences, totaling seven over the ten-year span. Case fatality rates (CFRs) varied, with some months showing a 100% CFR (July 2014, October 2014, December 2017, August 2020, and September 2022) while other months report cases with no deaths. Notably, August 2023 accounts for four cases with one death, indicating a CFR of 25%. Overall, the death toll remained low annually, with no discernible trends in fatality rates, aligning with the sporadic and contained nature of plague incidents reported.

## Introduction

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It primarily affects rodents and is transmitted to humans through fleabites from infected fleas, or contact with contaminated fluid or tissue from a dead host. Notoriously known for causing the "Black Death" in the Middle Ages, it frequently occurs in three forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Early detection and antibiotic treatment are crucial to reduce the risk of severe complications or death.


## Highlights

1. Plague cases in mainland China have remained consistently low since 2010, with occasional spikes <br/>
2. The death rate stayed generally proportional to the case rate, implying potentially effective disease management <br/>
3. August and September appear to be critical months with slightly higher incidence, indicating potential seasonal trends <br/>
4. The single case in November 2023 implies ongoing vigilance in monitoring and managing the disease despite the low overall prevalence.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Plague incidences in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 represent sporadic occurrences, with the total case count remaining low and occurrences being rather irregular. There appears to be no clear seasonal trends in the pattern of plague cases. There is an observed increase in incidence in 2019, with the highest number of 4 cases happening in November. However, the numbers remain too low to confirm any significant changes in plague epidemiology in China.

### Deaths Analysis
The plague-associated mortality in mainland China during the specified period is also low, mirroring the sporadic nature of the cases. It appears there is a somewhat consistent case fatality rate, given the parallel occurrences of deaths and cases, such as in September 2012, July 2014, and August 2020. Unexpectedly, a death was reported in January 2020 without new cases being recorded, implying a case from the previous month with a delayed fatal outcome. This highlights the need for prompt and effective treatment.

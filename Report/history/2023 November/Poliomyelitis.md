## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, commonly known as Polio, is an infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children. It invades the nervous system, potentially leading to permanent paralysis. The virus is transmitted through contaminated food or water and multiplies in the intestine. Polio has no cure but can be prevented through immunization. The global initiative to eradicate Polio, launched in 1988, has resulted in a 99% reduction in its worldwide incidence.
## Highlights

- Zero reported cases and deaths from Poliomyelitis in Chinese mainland from November 2013 through November 2023, indicating no active transmission of the disease for a decade. <br/>
- The consistent absence of cases suggests effective immunization and surveillance strategies have been maintained throughout this period. <br/>
- Given the global effort to eradicate polio, China's sustained zero-case status aligns with the World Health Organization's objectives, hinting at the success of the Polio Eradication Initiative in the region. <br/>
- Continuous vigilance is necessary to ensure rapid response to any potential re-emergence, especially considering proximity to countries where polio remains endemic or poses a risk. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The presented data for the Chinese mainland from November 2013 to November 2023 shows a continuous record of zero reported cases of poliomyelitis (polio). This remarkable consistency suggests highly effective surveillance, vaccination, and public health measures are in place and rigorously maintained. The sustained absence of cases for a decade indicates likely interruption of poliovirus transmission within the population, highlighting the success of the polio eradication initiatives in this region.

### Deaths Analysis
Corresponding to the consistently reported zero cases of poliomyelitis over the ten-year span, there have been zero deaths attributed to polio in the Chinese mainland. This indicates an effective prevention of disease manifestations that could lead to fatalities. The absence of mortality from polio further reinforces the effectiveness of China's immunization program and suggests robust health infrastructure capable of maintaining polio-free status, considering polio's high potential for causing death in the absence of such measures.

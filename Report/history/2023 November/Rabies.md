## Introduction

Rabies is a deadly virus transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of infected animals. It invades the central nervous system, causing disease in the brain and often results in death if left untreated. Rabies can affect all mammals, but is most commonly found in wild animals like bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Efficient post-exposure prophylaxis has made the disease preventable in humans. Worldwide, dogs remain the most significant source of human infection, hence the importance of canine vaccination programs.


## Highlights

1. Overall Decreasing Trend: There has been an overall decrease in both rabies cases and deaths from 2010 to November 2023. Highest recorded cases (233) in September & October 2010, with the highest death toll (208) in November 2010, significantly higher compared to 2023 levels.<br/>
2. Seasonal Fluctuations: Each year sees peaks during summer months (around June - August), indicating possible seasonal factors affecting the spread.<br/>
3. High Fatality: A notably high death-to-case ratio through the years implies a high fatality rate for rabies in mainland China.<br/>
4. Current Status: As of November 2023, cases (12) and deaths (14) are both relatively low, continuing the overall downward trajectory.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the thirteen-year period (2010-2023), Rabies cases in mainland China indicated an overall downward trend. The average case count was highest in 2010 with numbers declining from 2011 onward. The most considerable drop was seen between 2010 and 2011 with cases decreasing by 40%. The number of cases remained relatively consistent afterwards, trickling downwards until 2022 with a temporary rise in 2013, though none of these periods superseded the 2011 cases. No data was available for January and February of 2013.
 
### Deaths Analysis
Similar to cases, Rabies-related deaths also showed a declining trend across the period. Despite the high correspondence life threat of Rabies, the mortality rate generally improved over time with fewer deaths relative to the number of cases each year -- suggesting possible improvements in rapid diagnosis, health service accessibility, or treatment.  A sizable dip in deaths was noticed in September 2012 and needs further investigation. Notably, despite fewer cases in recent years, the death amount saw a relative increase in December 2021 and 2022, warranting further exploration of possible factors.

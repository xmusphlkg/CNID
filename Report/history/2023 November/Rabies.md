## Introduction

Rabies is a deadly viral infection primarily transmitted to humans through bites, scratches, or licks on broken skin from infected animals, typically dogs. It affects the central nervous system, leading to progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fever, headache, excess salivation, muscle spasms, paralysis, and mental confusion. Without immediate treatment with a Rabies Immunoglobulin and continued vaccination post-exposure, it is typically fatal after neurological symptoms have developed. Vaccination is crucial in controlling the spread of rabies.

## Highlights

1. There has been a consistent decline in rabies cases and related deaths in mainland China from January 2010 to November 2023.<br/>
   
2. In peak seasons (June through October), both the number of cases and deaths have also decreased over time, reflecting effective disease control.<br/>

3. The case fatality rate (number of deaths divided by number of cases) has also improved over the years, suggesting better post-exposure treatment to rabies.<br/>

4. As of November 2023, the rabies situation is significantly better compared to the same period in 2010, with the new cases and deaths at the lower end of the scale.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Rabies exhibited a declining trend in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. Early in 2010, monthly cases fluctuated around 150-200, gradually decreasing towards the end of the year. In 2011, a slight rise in cases was observed, primarily during the summer. This pattern evolved into more substantial declines from 2012 through 2023, with instances in 2023 as low as 5â€“15 recorded cases per month. The significant decline is indicative of effective surveillance and control measures; however, fluctuations highlight the need for continuous monitoring and prevention efforts.

### Deaths Analysis
A high mortality rate was observed throughout, with deaths often following the same pattern as cases, indicating the deadly nature of rabies. Remarkably, the deaths per month displayed a similar trend to the number of cases, dropping from triple digits in the early 2010s to mostly single-digit numbers by 2023. Despite the significant improvement, the persistence of rabies mortality reaffirms a crucial ongoing public health challenge. Continued efforts are required to target at-risk populations and improve post-exposure prophylaxis to further reduce fatalities.

## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German Measles, is a contagious viral disease. It is often mild in children, but can have severe consequences in adults, particularly for pregnant women, as it may cause serious birth defects, including heart problems, loss of hearing and eyesight, or mental disabilities. Spread through coughs and sneezes, symptoms include a red rash, fever, and swollen glands. Rubella is preventable with the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine, reinforcing the importance of vaccinations in public health.

## Highlights

1. There has been a sustained decrease in Rubella cases in mainland China over the long term, from a high in 2011 (approximately 18,445 per month), down to low hundreds in 2023. <br/>
2. Seasonality is observed in the data, with cases generally peaking between March and May each year. This corresponds to the typical epidemiology of Rubella, which often exhibits springtime peaks in temperate climates. <br/>
3. The fatality associated with the disease remained very low, with only a handful of deaths reported across the entire study period. <br/>
4. As of November 2023, the situation appears stable, with 89 cases of Rubella reported and no deaths. This indicates effective disease control policies are in place. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The Rubella cases in mainland China exhibit a seasonal pattern, peaking around April-May for most years (2010: 13,026; 2011: 18,445; 2012: 10,125; 2019: 9,095). The number of cases began decreasing gradually after 2011 until 2018, when spikes were seen in April (472 cases) and December (786 cases). Such fluctuations may reflect varying efficiency of controlled measures and vaccination rates. However, after 2019, the case number remained relatively low, reflecting effective interventions or possibly shifts in disease surveillance.

### Deaths Analysis

Overall, Rubella's mortality rate appears to be low in this region, with few reported deaths (7) between 2010-2022. The single death occurrences in May 2010, April 2011, July 2011, November 2012, March 2015, June 2019, and March 2022 are sporadic and suggest proper medical care or effective vaccination efforts to inhibit severe conditions. Nonetheless, each of these instances needs a thorough investigation to ensure strategies designed to maintain this low mortality rate are effective and continuous.

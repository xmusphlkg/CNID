## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German measles, is a viral infection characterized by a distinctive red rash. Spread through nasal or throat secretions, it is typically a mild illness in children and adults. However, if contracted by pregnant women, especially in the first trimester, it can result in severe birth defects or miscarriage, known as Congenital Rubella Syndrome. Vaccination is the best defense against rubella, incorporated in the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) immunization typically administered in early childhood.
## Highlights

- Significant decline in rubella cases from a peak in May 2011 to consistently low numbers by November 2023, indicating effective disease control and possibly successful vaccination strategies. <br/>
- Sporadic minor peaks suggest localized outbreaks, but overall trend shows rubella is well-contained with no reported deaths in the most recent years. <br/>
- The extremely low case numbers in 2023, coupled with zero deaths, suggest rubella is not currently a major public health concern in mainland China. <br/>
- Continuous surveillance and vaccination efforts may be contributing to the sustained low incidence of rubella in the Chinese mainland as of November 2023.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Rubella cases in the Chinese mainland peaked annually each April-May during 2010-2019, suggesting seasonality. The yearly peak reduced markedly post-2019; however, the reason is unclear but could be linked to public health interventions or underreporting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data from 2010 to 2013 shows a high variability in case numbers, with a significant drop from 2014 onwards. The sharp decrease in cases from the beginning of 2020 suggests possible effects of COVID-19 related measures (e.g., lockdowns, social distancing) on the transmission of rubella.

### Deaths Analysis
Fatal outcomes from rubella are exceedingly rare, as underscored by the Chinese mainland data spanning over a decade, with only 4 deaths reported despite tens of thousands of cases. The sporadic nature of fatalities (occurring in May 2010, April and July 2011, June 2019, and March 2022) doesn't indicate any noticeable pattern or increase over time, reinforcing rubella's low mortality rate. The consistent zero-death reports for most months highlight rubella's low lethality and possibly effective clinical management of complications.

## Introduction

Rubella, commonly known as German measles, is a contagious viral infection. It is characterized by a distinctive red rash, mild fever, and symptoms like headache and runny nose. Rubella is preventable via the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. It is particularly important for pregnant women to avoid the disease as it can lead to congenital rubella syndrome in the unborn child, causing severe birth defects or fetal death. The World Health Organization declared the Americas rubella-free in 2015 due to successful vaccination programs.
## Highlights

- The overall trend for Rubella cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 shows an initial high prevalence with a peak in 2010 and 2011, where cases reached over 18,000 in May 2011, followed by a gradual decline. <br/>
- Since 2015, reported Rubella cases have decreased significantly, with numbers generally remaining below 1,000 cases per month, indicating effective control measures may be in place. <br/>
- While there have been sporadic increases in cases, such as in March 2019 with over 3,000 cases, the overall pattern remains one of low-level transmission with occasional small outbreaks. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the disease situation appears to be under control, with 89 reported cases and no deaths, continuing the trend of reduced incidence observed over the past several years. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data spans over a decade, revealing a significant peak in Rubella cases during 2010â€“2012. Initially, cases surged in April 2010, reaching over 7,000 instances and escalating to a historic high in May 2011 with 18,445 cases. Following this period, a gradual but notable decline is observed, and by 2018, cases remained consistently below 1,000 per month. From 2020 onwards, the number of cases dropped further, likely due to public health measures and vaccination efforts, maintaining a stable low rate through 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
Rubella-associated fatalities in the Chinese mainland are exceedingly rare across the data set. Among over 90 recorded data points, only four reported deaths were attributed to the disease, each in a separate year (2010, 2011, 2012, 2019 and 2022), suggesting an exceptionally low case fatality rate. This rarity in fatalities highlights the generally mild nature of the illness and potentially effective clinical management and vaccination strategies aimed at minimizing severe outcomes of the infection.

## Introduction

SARS-CoV, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, is a viral strain responsible for severe respiratory infections in humans. Identified in 2003, it originated in China and spread globally, causing a significant and deadly pandemic. It's characterized by symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath, often leading to severe pneumonia. SARS-CoV is spread via close person-to-person contact, typically through respiratory droplets produced during coughing or sneezing. As a coronavirus, it belongs to the same family as the common cold and the severe virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19.

## Highlights

- The data indicates no reported cases of SARS-CoV in Chinese mainland from January 2010 through November 2023, reflecting effective containment and surveillance measures over the 14-year period. <br/>
- An anomaly in recorded data is observed in May 2012, with no cases reported but 1093 deaths. This outlier likely indicates a reporting error or data entry issue, as such a number of deaths without corresponding cases is epidemiologically and clinically improbable. <br/>
- The consistent absence of cases post-May 2012 till November 2023 suggests the disease is no longer endemic or causing outbreaks within Chinese mainland, implying successful eradication efforts or lack of disease circulation in the human population. <br/>
- The continuous zero-case trend in recent years, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened disease surveillance, underscores the absence of SARS-CoV transmission and the likely discontinuation of the virus in mainland China. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows no reported cases of SARS-CoV in the Chinese mainland from January 2010 through March 2023. Consistently, the case count remains at zero throughout the observed period, indicating either a high effectiveness of surveillance and containment measures or a potential under-reporting or absence of the disease in this geographic area during these years. Without additional context or data, conclusions about disease incidence and prevalence cannot be drawn.

### Deaths Analysis
According to the provided data set, there were no reported deaths from SARS-CoV in the Chinese mainland from January 2010 through March 2023, with the exception of May 2012, which anomalously reports 1,093 deaths. This figure is highly irregular considering the absence of reported cases and may suggest a data entry error or misclassification of the disease cause. Since SARS-CoV had its outbreak contained by 2004, the data entry for May 2012 requires further investigation to validate correctness.

## Introduction

SARS-CoV, short for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, is a viral species connected to severe respiratory diseases in humans. First identified during the 2002-2003 outbreak in Guangdong, China, it's characterized by atypical pneumonia symptoms. The virus is zoonotic, believed to be transmitted from bats via civets to humans, presenting a global health threat due its high contagion capabilities combined with a significant mortality rate. It belongs to the broader Coronaviridae family of viruses, which also includes the novel SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Highlights

1. Sustained Zero Incidence: No cases of SARS-CoV have been reported in mainland China since 2010, indicating effective containment and prevention measures. <br/>
2. Anomaly in Death Reports: An unusual surge in deaths was observed in May 2012, with 1093 deaths recorded but no corresponding cases. This could perhaps be due to reporting errors or late attribution of cause. <br/>
3. Consistent Zero Mortality: Apart from the anomalous event in May 2012, no SARS-CoV-related deaths have occurred, indicating successful treatment of any sporadic cases. <br/>
4. Current Situation: As of November 2023, mainland China reports zero cases and deaths, continuing containment success. <br/>


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
There have been zero reported SARS-CoV cases in mainland China between January 2010 and November 2023. The persistent null findings over these nearly 14 years suggest effective control measures, possibly due to the extensive management actions implemented after the 2002â€“2004 SARS-CoV outbreak. These actions may include strict infection prevention measures in healthcare settings, intensive case finding and isolation procedures, and public awareness campaigns. However, continuous surveillance and prevention control should not be relaxed, as the re-emergence of such viruses is always a possibility.

### Deaths Analysis
The data indicates zero deaths reported for SARS-CoV within the same period, except for a notably anomalous data point of 1093 deaths without reported cases in May 2012. This discrepancy requires further investigation as it may be due to error entry, data correction, or previously unreported cases pertaining to an earlier period. Despite this isolated incident, the overall death figures are congruent with the case figures, emphasizing the effectiveness of the implemented control mechanisms while highlighting the importance of accurate, timely, and transparent reporting.

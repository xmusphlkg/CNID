## Introduction

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by schistosomes, flatworms that infect the urinary or intestinal system. Transmission occurs through contact with contaminated water, where the parasitic larvae penetrate human skin. Symptoms range from abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in stool or urine, to severe liver or bladder damage in chronic cases. According to the World Health Organization, schistosomiasis affects over 200 million people worldwide, primarily in Africa, the Middle East, South America, and Asia, presenting significant public health implications.
## Highlights

- Significant spike in case numbers observed in mid-2015, with the peak at 10,481 cases in November 2015 followed by a drastic decline after this period.<br/>
- Since 2016, the number of Schistosomiasis cases has shown a dramatic decrease, reaching single or low double digits from 2020 onwards, indicating effective control measures.<br/>
- After the first recorded death in February 2020, no subsequent deaths have been reported, suggesting improved clinical management and possibly better access to healthcare.<br/>
- As of November 2023, Schistosomiasis cases have remained at a consistently low level, indicating sustained control of the disease in the Chinese mainland.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Schistosomiasis in the Chinese mainland indicate a substantial decline from November 2013 to November 2023. Notable peaks occurred in mid-2015 with a maximum of 10,481 cases in November. However, post-2015, there's a drastic reduction, with cases mostly in the single to double digits, representing successful control measures. The occasional surge, like September 2017 with 1,166 cases, suggests intermittent outbreaks. The overall trend illustrates an effective downward trajectory in Schistosomiasis incidence, likely a result of concerted public health efforts and community interventions.

### Deaths Analysis
The data set shows no deaths from Schistosomiasis from November 2013 until February 2020, where a single death is recorded. The absence of fatalities for the vast majority of the period analyzed points to either mild disease manifestation, effective treatment regimens, or under-reporting of fatal cases. Given the endemic nature of Schistosomiasis, the zero-fatality rate raises questions about the accuracy of death reporting and whether Schistosomiasis-related complications might have been attributed to other causes. Nevertheless, the single death reported in over nine years suggests a relatively low mortality rate for this disease in the Chinese mainland.

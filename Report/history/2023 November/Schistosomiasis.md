## Introduction

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma flatworms. The disease, prevalent mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, is transmitted through freshwater infested with the parasite. Humans contract the disease when their skin contacts infested water, allowing the worms to penetrate their bodies. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool or urine, and possible organ damage in chronic cases. According to the World Health Organization, schistosomiasis affects nearly 240 million people worldwide. Effective treatment is available through antiparasitic drugs.
## Highlights

- A significant peak in reported Schistosomiasis cases occurred in 2015, with November recording the highest at 10,481 cases. There were no associated deaths during this peak. <br/>
- After 2015, there is a notable decline in cases, with minimal fluctuations, and the years 2020 through 2023 exhibit consistently low case numbers, suggesting successful control measures. <br/>
- The mortality associated with Schistosomiasis has remained extremely low throughout the observed period, and there are several years with zero recorded deaths. <br/>
- As of November 2023, Schistosomiasis cases have reduced to very low levels (3 cases), indicating effective ongoing control or elimination efforts within mainland China.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China, as reported, show a fluctuating trend with significant peaks and troughs from 2010 to 2023. Initially, cases increased, peaking between 2010 and 2015, with an unprecedented spike in May 2015 (4664 cases). Beyond 2015, a sharp decline is observed. Another notable peak occurs in October 2016 (2135 cases), followed by a drastic drop to single or low double-digits from 2017 onwards. The data suggest a successful intervention or change in reporting after 2015. However, there are sporadic resurgences, such as those seen in September 2017 (1166 cases) and October 2017 (3144 cases). Since 2018, cases have largely remained below 30 each month, with occasional minor increases.

### Deaths Analysis
Schistosomiasis-associated mortality rates in mainland China are minimally presented in the data from 2010 to 2023. Throughout the 13-year span, there were only 5 reported deaths despite fluctuating case numbers. The first reported deaths happened in May and December 2011, then a small cluster in mid-2012, with three in June and two in July. Following that, single deaths were recorded in June 2013 and February 2020. The low death incidence may reflect effective treatment and control measures. Despite significant case numbers, particularly in the earlier years, the sustained low mortality rates suggest that while transmission may occur, it has minimal impact on mortality due to prompt diagnosis, treatment, or less virulent strains.

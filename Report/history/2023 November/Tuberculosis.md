## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infectious disease primarily caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It usually affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also affect other body parts (extrapulmonary TB). Transmission occurs through airborne droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Its symptoms include persistent cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. TB is a global public health issue, particularly in developing countries, partly due to factors like HIV co-infection and emergence of drug-resistant TB. It can be prevented and treated with proper healthcare measures.
## Highlights

- Tuberculosis (TB) cases in the Chinese mainland peaked in March over several years, with a noticeable spike in 2022. 
<br/>
- The death toll from TB showed a significant increase starting in 2022, reaching its highest levels in the analyzed data, even as the number of cases began to decrease. 
<br/>
- Most recent data from November 2023 indicates a continuation of the downward trend in TB cases (57,432), yet the death rate remains elevated (320 deaths) compared to earlier years. 
<br/>
- Despite the reduction in the number of TB cases, the relatively high mortality rate suggests a need for continued public health interventions and improved TB management and treatment strategies.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
A clear seasonal pattern emerges from the tuberculosis data in China, with peaks often occurring in March, suggesting a cyclical trend possibly linked to environmental or social factors. From 2010 to 2013, cases gradually increased, possibly due to rising detection rates or population growth. Post-2013, a steady decline in the number of cases is observed, hinting at improved control measures. However, 2022 and 2023 report a significant decrease in cases compared to previous years, potentially indicating advancements in TB management or underreporting due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
The tuberculosis mortality rate in China shows fluctuation with an alarming rise from 2010 (141 deaths in January) to 2023 (320 deaths in November). The mortality had been relatively stable from 2010 to 2019, albeit with recurrent peaks. Notably, a substantial increase in deaths is evident from 2020 onwards, with deaths more than doubling by 2022, peaking in July (367 deaths). The sudden rise in mortality could correlate with healthcare system strains or altered health-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, warranting further investigation into the cause and potential co-factors.

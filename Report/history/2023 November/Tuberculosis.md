## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Usually affecting the lungs, it can also damage other parts of the body. It is transmitted through the air when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Although preventive measures and treatment exist, TB remains a major global health issue. Symptoms include a persistent cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. Multidrug-resistant TB is a worldwide concern, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and suitable treatment.
## Highlights

- A sustained decrease in TB cases in mainland China from January 2010 (105,877 cases) to November 2023 (57,432 cases) indicates a continued decline in incidence. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, TB-related deaths began to rise sharply from January 2022, with mortality rates reaching higher levels than any time since 2010. <br/>
- The increased mortality rate post-2021 suggests potential issues such as increased virulence, reporting changes, or challenges in treatment and healthcare access. <br/>
- A significant drop in cases and deaths in February 2020 hints at possible healthcare system strains during the COVID-19 pandemic onset. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis:
From 2010 to 2023, Tuberculosis (TB) cases in mainland China showed an overall declining trend with some fluctuations. An initial peak occurred in March 2010 with 138,574 cases, followed by subsequent peaks in March for most years, indicative of potential seasonal trends. Cases progressively decreased over time, particularly notable from 2020, likely influenced by public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching the lowest reported figure of 33,951 cases in December 2022. However, there's been a minor uptick in cases since then, as observed in the first half of 2023.

### Deaths Analysis:
The number of deaths associated with TB in China fluctuated over the years with a general increase, especially toward the latter years. It started with 141 deaths in January 2010, and despite some variability, death counts rose sharply from 2022, peaking in July with 367 deaths. This worrying trend continues into 2023, with an average monthly death count around 327 cases. The mortality data indicate that while incidence has decreased, the lethality of TB may be on the rise or detection and reporting of mortality have become more accurate over time.

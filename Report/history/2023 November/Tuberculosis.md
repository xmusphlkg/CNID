## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease primarily affecting the lungs, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It's typically spread through the air when someone with the disease coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include persistent cough, fatigue, fever, and weight loss. Despite the availability of effective treatments and a vaccine, TB remains a major global health problem, especially in developing countries and among people with compromised immune systems. It is noteworthy that many TB infections are latent, meaning they do not exhibit symptoms, yet they could possibly progress into active disease.

## Highlights

1. The monthly numbers of tuberculosis cases in mainland China have been showing a consistent decline from 105,877 in January 2010 to 57,432 in November 2023.<br/>
2. Despite the reduction in total cases, tuberculosis mortality presented a growing trend from 141 deaths in January 2010, hitting its peak of 367 deaths in July 2022, and falling to 320 deaths in November 2023.<br/>
3. The case-fatality ratio, calculated as deaths/cases, showed an upward trend, indicating an increase in disease severity or inadequacy in treatment success.<br/>
4. A functional health program is suggested to continue the trend of decreasing tuberculosis cases and tackle the rising mortality rate.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the past decade, mainland China has seen a varying trend in the number of Tuberculosis (TB) cases reported monthly. From 2010 until 2020, there was generally a decreasing trend in the total count, indicating successful controlling measures or changes in reporting. However, the fluctuation is noticeable within each year, with a typical peak in March which could be associated with increased indoor exposure during winter. Notably, there was a substantial decrease in cases during early 2020 speculatedly due to the COVID-19 pandemic measures. Starting from 2021 till 2023, a slower yet consistent gradual reduction is apparent, suggesting continuous effforts in Tuberculosis control.

### Deaths Analysis
Conversely, mainland China exhibited a unique trend with TB-related deaths over the years. The monthly fatalities remained low and relatively consistent throughout 2010 to 2019, with minor fluctuations. However, a substantial leap in the death toll was seen from 2020 onwards, with deaths per month often exceeding 300 in 2022 and 2023, a sharp contrast to the previous decade. The sudden surge could reflect new challenges in TB control, adapting health systems or comorbidities related to COVID-19. Despite the higher number, the overall trend appears stable, compelling further inquiry into the factors behind the surge.

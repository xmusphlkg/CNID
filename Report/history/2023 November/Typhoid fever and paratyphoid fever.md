## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are bacterial infections caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, respectively. Transmitted through contaminated food or water, they present similar symptoms including high fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea or constipation. Typhoid, generally more severe, can cause life-threatening complications. Paratyphoid is less common and usually presents a milder form of the disease. Both are prevalent in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene, predominantly in developing countries. Vaccines are available for typhoid, but not paratyphoid, making hygiene measures the main form of prevention.
## Highlights

- Cases of Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever have shown a declining trend in the Chinese mainland over the past decade, with the number of cases peaking around the summer months annually. <br/>
- There has been a notable decrease in reported cases from 2010 to 2023, with 1867 cases in August 2010 compared to 678 cases in August 2023, indicating improved prevention and control. <br/>
- Mortality associated with these diseases has been relatively low over the years, with sporadic deaths reported and some years with no fatalities. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, the overall trend suggests progress in disease management, though continued surveillance is necessary to maintain control and prevent outbreaks. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to November 2023, cases of Typhoid and paratyphoid fever in Chinese mainland showed seasonality, peaking during the summer months from July to September annually. The highest monthly case count was reported in August 2010 (1867 cases), followed by notable summertime peaks in subsequent years. A general decreasing trend was observed over the years, with the latest data from 2023 displaying substantially fewer cases compared to the beginning of the time series. The seasonality combined with the overall downtrend suggests effectiveness in control measures and possible changes in risk factors.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths from Typhoid and paratyphoid fever in the given timeframe are low, totaling 20 fatalities over approximately 13 years. Deaths were sporadic rather than perennial, with some years recording no fatalities. The highest annual death count was three in June 2017. Importantly, in multiple years, months with the highest case incidence did not correspond to increased mortality, suggesting that access to treatment or the severity of cases may not be directly correlated with case quantity. The data implies that while infections occurred, the fatality risk for these conditions was generally well-contained.

## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are bacterial infections caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, respectively. Contracted through contaminated food or water, these illnesses present similar symptoms such as prolonged high fever, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and constipation or diarrhea. If untreated, complications may occur, sometimes fatal. Vaccine-preventable, personal hygiene and safe food and water practices aid in prevention. Paratyphoid is less severe but shares enough symptoms to be often mistaken for Typhoid. These diseases are prevalent in areas with poor sanitation.
## Highlights

- Declining trend in reported cases of Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever from a peak in 2010 to significantly lower rates by November 2023. <br/>
- The mortality associated with these infections in Chinese mainland is very low, with years experiencing no or a maximum of three deaths, despite the varying number of cases. <br/>
- Notable is the reduction of cases since the start of 2020, which coincides with the global COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting possible impacts of overlapping public health interventions or reporting changes. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the situation appears relatively controlled with 377 cases and no deaths, maintaining the trend of low case fatality rates for these diseases in the region. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Observing the reported data for Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023, a seasonal pattern emerges with cases peaking during the summer months, likely due to factors such as higher temperatures and rainfall affecting water quality and sanitation. Overall, there seems to be a slight decrease over the years, with the highest number of monthly cases reported in August 2010 (1867 cases) and a general downward trend noticeable post-2018, reaching the lowest in December 2022 (234 cases). Periodic fluctuations in case numbers are apparent, and the data indicate that the disease is endemic, with continuous presence in the population.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality data linked to Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever cases in Chinese mainland demonstrate an exceptionally low death rate, with total reported deaths rarely exceeding 1 per month. Notably, no death spike correlates with the high incidence peaks, suggesting effective clinical management and possibly widespread antibiotic use mitigating the risk of fatal outcomes. Although few, the sporadic occurrences of mortality predominantly happen in the months with higher incidences, hinting at a relationship between case load and fatality risk. The data from January 2010 to November 2023 reveal a total of 22 deaths, underscoring the relatively low fatality of these diseases in the context of Chinese mainland.

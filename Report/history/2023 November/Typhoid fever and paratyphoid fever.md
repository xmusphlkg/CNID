## Introduction

Typhoid and Paratyphoid fevers are life-threatening illnesses caused by Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi bacteria, respectively. Both diseases, prevalent in regions with poor sanitation and a lack of clean water, are spread through the consumption of food or water contaminated by feces of an infected person. Clinically, they present similar symptoms including prolonged high fever, weakness, stomach pains, headache, and loss of appetite. Vaccines are available against Typhoid, but not against Paratyphoid. Antibiotics are the standard treatment for both diseases.
## Highlights

- There's an observable seasonal trend with cases peaking during the summer months, suggesting possible links to environmental factors or human activities during this period. <br/>
- Overall, cases of Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever have shown a declining trend over the years, with a notable decrease since 2010. <br/>
- Despite the declining trend, sporadic outbreaks and occasional deaths underscore the persistent risk and the need for continued surveillance and preventive measures. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the cases (377) and zero deaths indicate a maintenance of the general downward trend in disease prevalence, with occasional spikes. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The number of typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases in China's mainland shows clear seasonality with peaks during the warmer months from May to October, indicating possible seasonal factors influencing transmission, like increased bacterial proliferation or food handling practices. Between 2010 and 2023, there was a general trend of decreasing case numbers, dipping notably in 2020 which coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly due to enhanced hygiene measures. The post-2020 period continues to show reduced cases, suggesting a sustained impact or improved public health interventions.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the fluctuating number of cases annually, the reported deaths from typhoid and paratyphoid fevers remained low, with often zero or one monthly reported death. A few sporadic increases up to three deaths in a month were noted, with the highest in June 2017. This low mortality rate could reflect effective clinical management and treatment availability. Additionally, the near-elimination of deaths in recent years could be attributed to ongoing health initiatives, although underreporting cannot be ruled out.

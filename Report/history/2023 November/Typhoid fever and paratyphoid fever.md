## Introduction

Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are systemic illnesses caused by bacteria, Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi respectively. The diseases are primarily acquired through ingestion of contaminated food or water, characterized by prolonged fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. Both can develop into life-threatening complications without treatment. Typhoid is more severe compared to paratyphoid, being potentially fatal if untreated. Globally, these diseases are more common in areas lacking clean water and proper sanitation. The most effective prevention method is through maintaining hygienic water and food practices and vaccination.
## Highlights

- A general declining trend in the number of cases and deaths from typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever is observed, with peaks typically occurring during the summer months. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, there has been a significant decrease in cases from the peak in 2014 (1,787 cases in September) to November 2023 (377 cases). <br/>
- The fatality rate remains low, with only a few isolated deaths reported sporadically throughout the observed period, indicating effective clinical management. <br/>
- The lowest number of cases (234) was reported in December 2022, suggesting possible effective public health interventions or underreporting. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Typhoid and paratyphoid fever in mainland China from November 2013 to November 2023 show seasonal variation with peaks generally during the summer months, June through August, indicative of increased transmission in warmer periods. The highest number of cases (1787) was reported in September 2014. A downward trend is observed from 2014 to 2023, with cases decreasing from four-digit numbers to low three-digits, showing improved control and/or reporting over the years.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, deaths remained extremely low relative to case numbers, with occasional single fatalities reported sporadically throughout the years (a total of 15 deaths across a decade). The reported case-fatality ratio is thus very low, indicating either mild disease presentation, effective treatment, underreporting of deaths, or a combination thereof. The lone death in October 2023 after several months with no fatalities highlights the continued importance of surveillance.

## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are bacterial infections resulting from Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, respectively. Both diseases often manifest similar symptoms, including prolonged fever, malaise, and gastrointestinal complications. Primarily spread via contaminated food or water, these infections are common in areas with poor sanitation. Vaccination is available for typhoid, but is not completely effective, and no vaccine currently exists for paratyphoid. Antibiotics are essential for treatment, but the rise of drug-resistant strains remains a global concern. 

## Highlights

1. Over the decade from 2010-2020, there is an observable decrease in reportable cases of Typhoid and Paratyphoid fevers, suggesting successful control and prevention measures in Mainland China. <br/>
2. Despite the overall trend, seasonal increases in infections are consistent, with cases peaking during summer months (June - August) each year, demonstrating a potential environmental or lifestyle component influencing transmission.<br/>
3. The fatality rate remains relatively low throughout the years, and there is no evident trend towards increasing deaths despite occasional jumps, implying effective disease management.<br/>
4. As of November 2023, the number of cases has been lowered to 377 with zero deaths, continuing the general diminishing trend established over past years.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from 2010 to 2023 shows a seasonal trend in the number of Typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases in mainland China. Every year, cases tend to rise around April or May, peak during the summer months (June to August), then gradually decrease during autumn and winter. Considering the entire observed period, there is a subtle perceptible decrease in recorded cases, indicating potential improvements in sanitary conditions, immunization coverage, contamination control, healthcare provision, or public health awareness.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths from Typhoid and paratyphoid fever in mainland China are notably low during the entire period. These minimal numbers, when compared to the total case count, reflect high survival rates, indicating the effectiveness of the medical interventions that are available in the region or a general decrease in the virulence of the pathogen. However, the sporadic nature of deaths throughout the years suggests that risk factors are still present, which could include conditions affecting patients' immunity or variations in the virulence of the disease-causing organisms.

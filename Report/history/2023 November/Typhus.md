## Introduction

Typhus is an infectious disease typically carried by parasites such as lice, fleas, and ticks, and transmitted to humans through their bites. It is caused by bacteria of the genus Rickettsia. There are several types, which include epidemic typhus, scrub typhus, and murine typhus. Classic symptoms include high fever, headache, and rash. Without treatment, some forms of typhus can be life-threatening. Prevention focuses on avoiding contact with the vectors. Vaccines are not widely available, making early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment crucial.

## Highlights

1. General downtrend in cases: The data points to a general decrease in the number of Typhus cases from 2010 to 2023, evident in lower peak case numbers year-on-year.<br/>
2. Seasonal pattern continues: There's a noticeable annual trend with cases typically increasing from spring through to late autumn before decreasing in winter.<br/>
3. Low mortality rate: Across the given time frame, the overall mortality rate from Typhus is very low, with few deaths reported.<br/>
4. Slight recent uptick: Despite the long-term decline in Typhus cases, there has been a slight increase in the latter half of 2023, which merits close monitoring.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The typhus case data reveals an evident seasonal trend in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. The number of cases are lowest in the Winter and Spring (January-March) and peak in the Summer and Autumn (June-October). This may be due to climatic factors that encourage lice proliferation or human behaviors that increase exposure risks. While there was a downshift in yearly peak case numbers around 2017-2018, the count has since been gradually rising again, suggesting the necessity for continuous surveillance and prevention measures.

### Deaths Analysis
Instances of deaths due to typhus are sporadic and extremely low compared to the number of reported cases, implying successful disease management practices in mainland China. Throughout 2010-2023, only five fatal cases were recorded, occurring in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, and 2016, all during the Summer. These fatalities might be due to more severe disease forms, delayed treatment, or underlying conditions in patients. Despite the low mortality rate, regular monitoring and early intervention are crucial in maintaining this status.

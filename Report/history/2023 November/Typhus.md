## Introduction

Typhus is an infectious disease caused by Rickettsia bacteria, transmitted via lice, fleas, mites, and ticks. It consists of different forms including endemic (murine) typhus, epidemic (louse-borne) typhus, and scrub typhus. Its symptoms encompass fever, headache, rapid pulse rate, and rash. If untreated, it can lead to severe complications like encephalitis, pneumonia, kidney failure, and even death. The disease is prevalent in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Vaccines exist for prevention but are not widely available. Effective treatment typically includes antibiotic therapy.
## Highlights

- There is a discernible seasonality in typhus cases, with peaks generally occurring in the warmer months (May through August) that are conducive to the proliferation of the vectors responsible for transmission.
<br/>
- Over the years observed, there is a notable declining trend in the number of typhus cases, especially marked after 2011; however, periodic resurgences are apparent, such as those observed in the data for 2023.
<br/>
- The overall fatality rate appears to be very low, with only a few recorded deaths over the multi-year period, suggesting that the risk of death from typhus is limited in the context of the Chinese mainland or that interventions and treatments are effective.
<br/>
- As of November 2023, the case count for typhus stands at 170 with no reported deaths, indicating a consistent disease presence without significant mortality, in line with the trends of the previous years.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, typhus cases in Chinese mainland show a seasonal pattern with peaks generally in summer months. 2011 and 2014 saw the highest numbers, reaching over 300 and 250 cases respectively in their peak months. Mid-year surges suggest vector activity intensifies due to favorable weather conditions. A marked decline in cases occurred from 2018 onwards, with the exception of minor resurgences in 2021 and 2023, hinting at improved public health measures or reporting changes.

### Deaths Analysis
Fatalities from typhus across the same timeframe were exceedingly rare, with only four deaths recorded during this period: June 2010, May 2011, August 2015, and September 2016. The low mortality rate, despite fluctuations in case numbers, signifies either a less virulent strain circulating or effective treatment protocols. Given the small number of deaths relative to cases, it underscores typhusâ€™ generally low fatality risk with access to proper medical care in Chinese mainland.

## Introduction

Typhus is a group of infectious diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria, transmitted through insect vectors such as fleas, lice, and ticks. Notable forms include epidemic typhus, murine typhus, and scrub typhus. Symptoms often involve high fever, headache, body aches, and sometimes rash. Serious complications can occur if left untreated, potentially leading to organ damage or death. It commonly occurs in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions and some forms may cause epidemic outbreaks. Though eradicated in many areas, typhus remains a problem in developing nations.
## Highlights

- Seasonal peaks in typhus cases are apparent during warmer months (June-September) across multiple years in China. <br/>
- A long-term decreasing trend in case numbers is observed, with early 2010s showing higher incidence compared to 2023. <br/>
- Very low fatality rates suggest effective disease management and possibly lower virulence of the pathogen. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the data indicates 170 cases with no fatalities, confirming ongoing disease presence but controlled impact. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data for Typhus in the Chinese mainland over the years show a cyclical pattern, with case counts typically peaking during the summer months, which is consistent with increased vector activity in warmer weather. From 2010 to 2023, there is no clear trend in the annual number of cases, oscillating without a significant upward or downward trajectory. While cases hit a peak of 301 in October 2011, numbers generally remain below 300 cases per month. Data for January and February 2013 are missing, which may affect the accuracy of the trend analysis for that year.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality data associated with Typhus cases from 2010 to 2023 indicate low fatality, with only 4 reported deaths despite numerous cases. The deaths occurred in June 2010, May 2011, June 2014, and August 2016, all during the summer season, which could potentially correspond with higher case numbers or strain on healthcare systems. However, the sporadic nature of deaths suggests that the healthcare response is generally effective or that the pathogenicity of the circulating typhus strain(s) is low. The fatality rate is negligible across the observed period, pointing to the non-lethal nature of the disease with proper treatment or to successful control measures being in place.

## Introduction

Typhus is a group of infectious diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria, transmitted by lice, chiggers, fleas, or mites. Its two types are Epidemic Typhus and Endemic Typhus. Symptoms include high fever, headache, rash, and chills. In severe cases, confusion, delirium, or even coma can occur. Typhus was notable for causing numerous deaths in wartime, especially when people were in crowded, unsanitary conditions. Today, it's mostly controlled in developed countries via hygiene measures and pesticide use. Antibiotics effectively treat Typhus, while prevention focuses on avoiding the insects that spread the diseases.
## Highlights

- A decrease in case numbers was observed from late 2013 through 2017, suggesting successful control measures during these years. <br/>
- An increase in reported cases began in 2018, with further notable rises in 2021 and 2022, indicating potential lapses in prevention or increased transmission. <br/>
- Seasonal variation is apparent with case surges typically in late summer and autumn months, reflecting possibly vector-related transmission patterns. <br/>
- Mortality remains low, with only two deaths reported over the decade, suggesting effective clinical management of detected cases.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Typhus cases in Chinese mainland from November 2013 to November 2023 exhibit seasonality, with higher instances typically observed during summer and autumn months. After peaking at 257 cases in October 2014, there was a general declining trend until 2017. However, from 2018 onward, there's a gradual resurgence of cases, with September 2023 marking the highest count at 227 cases. Inter-annual fluctuations are notable, but the overall trend suggests a cyclical pattern with no sustained decrease in case numbers over the reported years.

### Deaths Analysis
Given the data from November 2013 to November 2023, fatalities due to typhus on the Chinese mainland are very rare, with only three reported deaths despite thousands of cases. One death each occurred in June 2014, August 2015, and September 2016. There have been no recorded deaths from typhus from October 2016 onwards, indicating that while the infection remains prevalent, it has a low mortality rate, or, alternatively, improved healthcare interventions and case management have effectively minimized fatalities.

Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the data provided, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in the incidence and mortality rates of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Chinese mainland. The number of cases and deaths fluctuates throughout the year, with certain months experiencing higher or lower values.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak periods for both AIDS cases and deaths in Chinese mainland are observed during the summer months, particularly in July and August. These months consistently exhibit higher numbers compared to other months. Conversely, the trough periods, characterized by relatively lower numbers of cases and deaths, occur during the winter months, particularly in January and February.

Overall Trends:
A general increase in the incidence and mortality rates of AIDS in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 is evident when considering the overall trends. However, it is essential to note that there are fluctuations within this broader trend, with certain years displaying higher numbers than others.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal patterns in the data suggest that various factors may be influencing the transmission and spread of AIDS in Chinese mainland. The higher incidence and mortality rates during the summer months could be attributed to increased social activities, such as travel and gatherings, which may facilitate disease transmission. Conversely, the lower numbers during the winter months may be due to decreased social interactions and possibly increased awareness and preventive measures during the colder season.

The overall increasing trend in the incidence and mortality rates of AIDS in Chinese mainland emphasizes the ongoing challenge of controlling and preventing the spread of the disease. It is crucial for public health authorities to continue implementing effective prevention strategies, including education, testing, and access to treatment, to alleviate the burden of AIDS in the country.

It is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided data and does not consider other potential factors that could influence the patterns and trends of AIDS in Chinese mainland, such as changes in testing practices or reporting systems. Further research and analysis are necessary to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of AIDS in the country.

## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). By damaging the immune system, HIV interferes with the body's ability to fight off infectious diseases and cancer. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. The virus can be transmitted through blood, semen, vaginal and rectal fluids, and breast milk. There are effective treatments that can significantly slow the disease's progress, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of transmission to others. Without treatment, those with AIDS typically survive about three years.

## Highlights

- A gradual increase in reported AIDS cases and deaths from 2010 to 2023, indicating a growing epidemic in Chinese mainland. <br/>
- Particularly high peaks in cases and deaths are observed towards the end of each year, which could suggest seasonality or reporting practices. <br/>
- The data for January 2013 and February 2013 are missing, which may impact the accuracy of trend analysis for that period. <br/>
- The cases in October 2023 are elevated (5210 cases), with a substantial number of deaths (1866), reflecting a continued need for enhanced public health interventions. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

From 2010 to 2023, Chinese mainland experienced fluctuations in monthly AIDS cases. Initial increases peaked in December 2010 (3,980), then showed variable patterns with subsequent highs in December of 2017 (6,622) and December 2018 (7,897). A notable decline occurred in March 2013, with missing data, then cases surged, reaching the preeminent peak in December 2021 (7,490). Cases diminished notably in January 2023 (1,815) then rose again in subsequent months, indicating a potential resurgence or reporting anomalies.

### Deaths Analysis

Deaths from AIDS followed an upward trend from 301 in January 2010 to a staggering 2,484 in December 2019, reflecting increased mortality despite improved treatments globally. A substantial decrease is observed in 2020, potentially due to reporting changes or healthcare interventions. However, deaths rose again, hitting the highest number in December 2021 (2,486). Interestingly, January 2023 showed a disproportionate increase in deaths (1,777) compared to cases, which could suggest reporting delays, changes in death attribution, or data quality issues. Subsequent months show continued high death rates, necessitating further investigation into potential causes and public health responses.

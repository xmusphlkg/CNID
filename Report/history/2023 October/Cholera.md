Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the provided data, a clear seasonal pattern emerges regarding the number of cholera cases in Chinese mainland. The majority of cases occur during the summer months, specifically from June to August. This aligns with the known transmission patterns of cholera, as the bacteria thrive in warm and humid conditions. During the winter months, from December to February, there is a decrease in the number of cases, with very few or even no cases reported.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for cholera cases in Chinese mainland is typically observed in August, with a significant increase in the number of cases. This can be attributed to a combination of favorable environmental conditions and heightened human activities during the summer, such as travel and outdoor gatherings. Conversely, the trough period occurs during the winter months, specifically from December to February, when the number of cases reaches its lowest point.

Overall Trends:
Overall, the number of cholera cases in Chinese mainland exhibits a fluctuating trend before October 2023. The cases vary from year to year, with certain years reporting higher case counts than others. However, there is no distinct upward or downward trend evident in the data.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal patterns in the data indicate that environmental factors, particularly temperature and humidity, influence cholera transmission in Chinese mainland. The peak in cases during the summer months underscores the importance of implementing preventive measures, such as improved sanitation and hygiene practices, during this period to mitigate the risk of cholera outbreaks. The decrease in cases during the winter months can be attributed to less conducive environmental conditions for the survival of cholera bacteria.

It is important to note that the data provided solely covers the period before October 2023. Further analysis and monitoring of cholera cases in Chinese mainland beyond this timeframe are necessary to assess any long-term trends or changes in the disease's epidemiology. Additionally, a comprehensive understanding of cholera transmission in Chinese mainland would benefit from analyzing other factors, such as geographical distribution and population demographics.

## Introduction

Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It primarily spreads through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Symptoms include severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Without prompt treatment, these symptoms can be life-threatening due to rapid fluid loss. Infection is most common in places with inadequate water treatment, poor sanitation, and hygiene practices. Preventative measures include improved sanitation, safe drinking water, and vaccines. Treatment consists of rehydration, using oral rehydration salts or intravenous fluids, and antibiotics in severe cases.

## Highlights

- Seasonal pattern observed with case spikes typically occurring from July to September, coinciding with the warm and rainy season conducive to cholera transmission. <br/>
- A notable steady presence of cases each year with no significant uptrend or downtrend over the period analyzed, reflecting an endemic situation. <br/>
- Zero fatality rates in most months suggest either a low virulence strain of Vibrio cholerae, effective treatment modalities, or underreporting of cholera-attributable deaths. <br/>
- As of October 2023, the situation remains stable with a low number of cholera cases (2) and no deaths, indicating ongoing control measures may be effective. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Cholera case distribution in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 indicates sporadic activity, with the absence of cases for extended periods and spikes often occurring in the summer months. The year 2010 was marked by a notable increase in August (63 cases), while other years generally observed far fewer cases. July and August seem to be high-risk months, aligning with factors favorable for Vibrio cholerae. Despite fluctuations, there is no discernible escalating trend in cholera cases over the observed years, and instances remain relatively low.

### Deaths Analysis

Death data signify an extremely low fatality rate for cholera in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023. Only 2 deaths were recorded, both in 2013, amidst a relatively low count of cases. This could illustrate the effectiveness of China's health system in cholera management and treatment responsiveness. The infrequency of deaths associated with cholera cases over the years supports the success of public health measures, including water sanitation, healthcare access, and possibly cholera vaccination efforts among at-risk populations.

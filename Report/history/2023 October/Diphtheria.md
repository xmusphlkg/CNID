Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the provided data, there is no clear seasonal pattern observed for cases of Diphtheria in Chinese mainland prior to October 2023. The number of cases remains consistently low throughout the years, with occasional spikes occurring in certain months.

Peak and Trough Periods:
There are no distinct peak and trough periods evident in the data. The number of cases remains consistently low, with occasional isolated spikes occurring in specific months.

Overall Trends:
The overall trend for cases of Diphtheria in Chinese mainland prior to October 2023 shows relative stability and a low number of cases. There is no significant increase or decrease in the number of cases over time.

Discussion:
The data indicates that cases of Diphtheria in Chinese mainland have consistently remained at a low level prior to October 2023. This suggests effective control and management of the disease in the country. The absence of a clear seasonal pattern suggests that the transmission of Diphtheria is not influenced by specific climatic or environmental factors. However, it is important to note that the provided data only covers a limited time period. Further analysis and monitoring are necessary to assess any long-term trends or changes in the incidence of Diphtheria in Chinese mainland.

## Introduction

Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. Symptoms include a sore throat, fever, swollen glands, and characteristic thick, gray coating on the throat or nose. If not treated, it can produce a toxin harming the heart, kidneys, and nerves. Vaccination is the best prevention. Diphtheria was once a common cause of death in children, but now it is rare in countries where vaccinations are routinely administered, though it may still be encountered in some regions with limited healthcare access.

## Highlights

- Diphtheria remains rare in Chinese mainland, with sporadic cases rather than sustained transmission or outbreaks. <br/>
- Since 2010, only a few cases have been reported, and they are not associated with any fatalities, suggesting effective case management and disease control efforts. <br/>
- A singular case was recorded in June 2023, aligning with the pattern of isolated occurrences seen annually in the previous years. <br/>
- Despite low incidence, the persistent presence of diphtheria cases emphasizes the importance of continued vaccination and surveillance. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Between January 2010 and October 2023, the reported cases of diphtheria in Chinese mainland were minimal, with occurrences recorded in only six isolated incidents (November 2010, October 2011, June 2018, August and September 2020, July 2021, July 2022, and June 2023). Each of these instances cited only a single case, for a total of seven reported cases during this extensive period. The sporadic nature of these cases, combined with the prolonged intervals of zero incidences, suggests an effective control and prevention strategy, likely due to widespread vaccination and robust public health measures.

### Deaths Analysis

Analyzing the death data associated with diphtheria from January 2010 to October 2023 in Chinese mainland reveals a remarkably low mortality rate. Out of the seven reported cases, only one resulted in a fatality, which occurred in September 2012. The almost nonexistent death records over these years reflect either a high level of effective clinical management for diagnosed cases or the possibility of underreporting. Nonetheless, it suggests that diphtheria is relatively well-contained in China, which could be attributed to the successful implementation of vaccination programs, particularly the DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccine.

Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the provided data, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in the incidence of Hepatitis A cases in Chinese mainland. The number of cases tends to be higher during the summer months (June to August) and lower during the winter months (December to February). This pattern is consistent across multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for Hepatitis A cases in Chinese mainland is typically observed in the summer months, particularly in July and August, when the number of cases reaches its highest point. Conversely, the trough period, which refers to the period with the lowest number of cases, is usually observed in the winter months, particularly in December and January.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there has been a declining trend in the number of Hepatitis A cases in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023. While the number of cases fluctuates from year to year, there is a general downward trend. However, it is important to note that there was a sudden decrease in reported cases in 2013, with negative values recorded for January and February. This anomaly may be attributed to issues with data reporting or other factors influencing data accuracy during that period.

Discussion:
The presence of a seasonal pattern in Hepatitis A cases in Chinese mainland suggests the influence of certain factors on disease transmission. The higher number of cases during the summer months could be linked to increased outdoor activities, warmer temperatures, and potentially inadequate sanitation practices. Conversely, the lower number of cases during the winter months may be attributed to reduced outdoor activities and improved hygiene practices.

The overall decreasing trend in Hepatitis A cases reflects the effectiveness of efforts to control and prevent the disease in Chinese mainland. This achievement can be attributed to improvements in sanitation and hygiene practices, increased vaccination coverage, and public health interventions. However, continuous monitoring of the situation and implementation of preventive measures are important for further reducing the burden of Hepatitis A in Chinese mainland.

It is worth highlighting that the sudden decrease in reported cases in 2013, with negative values for January and February, raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data during that period. Additional investigation and verification of the data are necessary to ensure its validity.

In conclusion, the analysis of monthly data on Hepatitis A cases in Chinese mainland reveals a consistent seasonal pattern with peak periods in the summer and trough periods in the winter. There is an overall decreasing trend in the number of cases, indicating progress in disease control efforts. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting the data, especially concerning the anomalous values recorded in 2013.

## Introduction

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). It is primarily spread through ingestion of contaminated food or water, or close contact with an infected person. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. While not typically chronic, it can cause acute liver failure, which can be fatal. Vaccination can prevent hepatitis A. Good hygiene practices, including hand washing, are also effective in stopping the spread of HAV. Most people recover with supportive care.

## Highlights

- A declining trend in reported cases of Hepatitis A from 2010 to October 2023, with peak numbers typically occurring in the summer months. <br/>
- Mortality has remained consistently low, with sporadic spikes, such as in May 2012, but has tapered to zero deaths reported since February 2023. <br/>
- An outlier event occurred in May 2012, with 56 deaths, suggesting a possible outbreak or reporting anomaly; otherwise, the fatality rate is minimal. <br/>
- Recent years have seen a significant reduction in cases, with 2022 recording some of the lowest figures, persisting into October 2023, indicating effective control measures may be in place. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The reported cases of Hepatitis A in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to October 2023 show a significant declining trend. Initially high in the early years, cases peaked in August 2010 at 3789. However, over the following years, a decrease can be observed, with occasional spikes. By 2023, the case numbers have notably reduced, with just 986 cases in October, demonstrating the effectiveness of public health interventions and possibly improved sanitation, vaccination efforts, and public awareness.

### Deaths Analysis

The death toll associated with Hepatitis A in the given timeframe was generally low, indicating a relatively low fatality rate for the disease in Chinese mainland. A notable outlier is May 2012, with an abrupt rise to 56 deaths. This spike could suggest an outbreak with a particularly virulent strain or issues in healthcare access. The subsequent years have seen minimal fatalities, often zero, which might be attributed to better clinical management of cases and widespread vaccination, contributing to the reduced severity of the disease's impact.

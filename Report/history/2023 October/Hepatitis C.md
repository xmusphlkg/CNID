Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the provided data, there appears to be a seasonal pattern in the incidence of Hepatitis C cases in Chinese mainland. The number of cases is higher during the winter months (December to February) and lower during the summer months (June to August). This pattern is consistent across multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods:
Peak periods for Hepatitis C cases in Chinese mainland occur during the winter months, particularly in December and January, consistently having the highest number of cases. The trough periods, representing the lowest number of cases, occur during the summer months, with July and August having the fewest cases.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there is a slight upward trend in the number of Hepatitis C cases in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023. Although the number of cases fluctuates from year to year, there is a general increase. However, it is important to note that there was a sudden decrease in cases in 2013, particularly in January and February, with a reported number of cases as -10. This anomaly may be attributed to data reporting issues or other factors affecting data accuracy.

Discussion:
The seasonal pattern of higher Hepatitis C cases during the winter months and lower cases during the summer months aligns with the known transmission patterns of the disease. Hepatitis C is primarily transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, and during the winter months, there may be increased opportunities for transmission through activities such as needle-sharing or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment.

The overall increasing trend in Hepatitis C cases in Chinese mainland suggests that efforts to control and prevent the disease may need to be intensified. Interventions targeting risk factors for transmission, including improving blood safety practices, promoting safe injection practices, and raising awareness and testing among high-risk populations, should be prioritized.

The sudden decrease in reported cases in 2013, specifically in January and February, raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data during that period. Further investigation is necessary to understand the reasons behind this anomaly and to ensure the accuracy of future data reporting.

It is also worth noting that the provided data only includes cases and deaths related to Hepatitis C. A more comprehensive analysis would require additional information regarding risk factors, demographic characteristics, and interventions implemented during the study period.

Overall, this analysis emphasizes the importance of monitoring and comprehending the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends of Hepatitis C in Chinese mainland to inform targeted prevention and control strategies.

## Introduction

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver, leading to inflammation. It is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is mostly spread through blood-to-blood contact. The infection can be acute or chronic, with the latter posing a risk for severe liver issues like cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer. Many individuals with hepatitis C may have no symptoms initially, but chronic infection can result in significant health complications over time. Treatments have greatly evolved, with antiviral medications offering a high cure rate for the infection.

## Highlights

- Gradual increase in Hepatitis C cases observed from 2010 to 2023, emphasizing the need for enhanced public health interventions. <br/>
- A dramatic surge in mortalities noticed from 2022, escalating in 2023, indicating potential changes in healthcare system efficacy or virus virulence. <br/>
- Marked peaks in cases often occur in the months of March through July, suggesting possible seasonal patterns in transmission or diagnosis rates. <br/>
- The October 2023 data shows a substantial mortality rate of about 1.15%, the highest throughout the period, warranting urgent epidemiological assessment and response strategies. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Over the period 2010 to 2023, the number of reported Hepatitis C cases in Chinese mainland reveals fluctuations with several peaks and troughs. Initially, cases ranged between 9,594 and 15,716 per month. A general uptrend is observed with peaks in March 2017 (24,076 cases) and again in March 2019 (24,053 cases). The year 2020 showed lower reporting, possibly due to confounding factors like the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting 2022, a marked downward trend is evident with December reporting only 11,050 cases, but there is a rebound in early 2023 with cases rising again to 23,214 in August.

### Deaths Analysis

The death toll associated with Hepatitis C in the studied timeframe exhibits an alarming exponential increase, especially noteworthy from June 2022 onwards. The data suggest a minor number of deaths per month, averaging below 20 prior to 2022. However, the mortality rate notably escalates in August 2022, reaching 45 deaths, and continues to surge to unprecedented levels, peaking at 224 deaths in October 2023. This trend hints at significant changes in either the virulence of the virus, access to effective healthcare, reporting practices, or other external health factors not represented in the data.

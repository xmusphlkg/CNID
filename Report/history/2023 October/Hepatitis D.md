Seasonal Patterns:
According to the provided data, there is no distinct seasonal pattern evident in the occurrence of Hepatitis D cases in Chinese mainland. The number of cases fluctuates throughout the years without displaying a consistent pattern.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The data does not exhibit any unquestionable peak and trough periods. The number of cases varies month to month without any consistent periods of higher or lower values.

Overall Trends:
When considering the overall trend, it is challenging to recognize a clear pattern or trend in the data. The number of cases fluctuates over time without displaying any consistent upward or downward trend.

Discussion:
The data pertaining to Hepatitis D cases in Chinese mainland up until October 2023 does not indicate any discernible seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, or overall trends. This suggests that the occurrence of Hepatitis D cases in China is not influenced by specific seasons or time periods. However, it is important to acknowledge that this analysis is solely based on the provided data, and it may not capture any long-term trends or patterns that could be present in a larger dataset. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of Hepatitis D in Chinese mainland, further analysis and examination of additional data would be necessary.

## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as delta hepatitis, is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which is an incomplete virus that requires the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) to replicate. HDV is transmitted through contact with infectious blood, percutaneous and mucosal exposure to infected body fluids, and can occur as either a co-infection with HBV or a superinfection in those already chronically infected with HBV. Chronic HDV infection can lead to more severe liver disease compared to HBV alone, including cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation.

## Highlights

- There is a decreasing trend in the number of Hepatitis D cases from a peak in 2016 and 2017, stabilizing at low numbers by 2023. <br/>
- No reported deaths, indicating either non-lethal Hepatitis D infections or effective management and treatment of cases. <br/>
- Cases fluctuate seasonally with some peaks but maintain a downward or stable trend from 2020 to 2023. <br/>
- The current situation as of October 2023 shows a modest number of cases (15) without any fatalities, suggesting controlled transmission of Hepatitis D in Chinese mainland. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

From 2016 to 2023, the reported Hepatitis D cases in Chinese mainland fluctuated without a clear trend, averaging approximately 32 cases per month. The highest monthly count was reported in May 2017 with 59 cases, whereas the lowest occurred in October and November 2022, each with 10 cases. A notable reduction in the number of cases began in 2020, potentially due to augmented public health measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The data suggest periodic increases that may align with seasonal or episodic factors, but a comprehensive epidemiological investigation would be required to determine specific causes.

### Deaths Analysis

The mortality data for Hepatitis D from 2016 to 2023 show no reported deaths in Chinese mainland, which indicates either a non-lethal nature of the cases or high efficacy of treatment protocols. This absence of fatalities could also be a result of underreporting or successful containment and management of disease progression among those infected. However, the lack of fatalities should be interpreted with caution, as it may not reflect the broader global context of Hepatitis D, where co-infection with Hepatitis B virus can result in more severe outcomes. Ongoing surveillance and preventive strategies remain crucial in maintaining these outcomes.

Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the provided data, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in the number of Hepatitis E cases in mainland China. The number of cases tends to be higher between March and July, with a peak in March. Conversely, from August to February, the number of cases generally decreases and reaches its lowest point in December and January. This pattern indicates a seasonal variation in the transmission of Hepatitis E.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The highest number of Hepatitis E cases in mainland China is reported in March, making it the peak period. Conversely, the lowest number of cases occurs in December and January, considered the trough period. These peak and trough periods demonstrate the seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of Hepatitis E.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there is a fluctuating trend in the number of Hepatitis E cases in mainland China. From 2010 to 2013, there is an increasing trend in the number of cases, with a peak in 2011. However, from 2014 to 2016, there is a decreasing trend in the number of cases. After 2016, there is a slight increase, but the number of cases remains relatively stable. The overall trend suggests that the incidence of Hepatitis E has experienced fluctuations over the years, with periods of increase and decrease.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal patterns in the data indicate that certain factors may influence the transmission of Hepatitis E in mainland China. The higher number of cases between March and July may be attributed to environmental factors, such as increased rainfall or temperature, which could favor the survival and transmission of the virus. Conversely, the lower number of cases during the winter months could be due to reduced exposure to the virus or changes in behavior, such as improved sanitation practices.

The overall trend in the number of cases suggests that the incidence of Hepatitis E in mainland China has fluctuated over the years. The increasing trend from 2010 to 2013 could be attributed to various factors, including changes in surveillance and reporting systems, increased awareness and testing, or changes in population susceptibility. The subsequent decrease in cases from 2014 to 2016 may be the result of interventions or natural fluctuations in the transmission dynamics of the virus.

It is important to note that the provided data only includes cases and deaths up until October 2023. Further analysis and monitoring of the data beyond this period would be necessary to assess the long-term trends and potential impact of interventions on the incidence of Hepatitis E in mainland China.
## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV). Typically transmitted through fecal-oral routes, such as contaminated water, it often results in acute infections. The disease is prevalent in regions with poor sanitation, particularly in parts of Asia and Africa. While it generally leads to a self-limiting infection, it can be severe in certain populations, such as pregnant women and individuals with pre-existing liver diseases. There are four main genotypes affecting humans with variable epidemiology. No specific treatment exists, and prevention hinges on maintaining quality water supplies and ensuring proper sanitation.

## Highlights

- Hepatitis E cases in mainland China show a cyclical pattern, with peaks often occurring in March, suggesting possible seasonal or behavioural factors. <br/>
- Overall mortality from Hepatitis E remains low, with death rates sporadically distributed across various months without a clear trend. <br/>
- A significant decline in cases and deaths is observed in 2020, possibly due to public health measures for COVID-19, highlighting the impact of interventions beyond their intended target. <br/>
- Since the decrease in 2020, the number of cases has been rising again but remained below pre-2020 levels as of October 2023, indicating a possible stabilization or ongoing control efforts. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to October 2023, mainland China reported increasing trends of Hepatitis E cases with seasonal fluctuations. A visible peak occurs in March annually, suggesting a possible seasonal pattern. Overall, the number of cases appears to rise from 2010 through 2013, with 2011 March reporting the highest number of cases (4262). Thereafter, the cases stabilize with slightly lower peaks, except for a marked dip in 2020, possibly due to public health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent years show a rebound to pre-pandemic levels.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths associated with Hepatitis E from 2010 to 2023 were relatively low, with an overall mortality range of 0-6 deaths per month. The highest mortality was observed in February 2010, March 2010, and December 2017, each recording 6 deaths. However, the mortality rate does not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend. The lack of data for multiple months in 2011 and no apparent association between the number of cases and deaths each month suggests a low fatality rate and potentially varying reporting standards or intervention efficacies across the years.

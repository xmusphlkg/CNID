Seasonal Patterns:
The provided data demonstrates a clear seasonal pattern in cases of human H7N9 virus infection in Chinese mainland. The majority of cases occur during the winter months, specifically from December to February. This is evident from the higher number of cases reported during these months compared to the rest of the year. Case numbers begin to rise in November and reach their peak in January or February. Following the peak, the number of cases gradually declines, with very few or no cases reported during the summer months.

Peak and Trough Periods:
Typically, the peak period for human H7N9 virus infection in Chinese mainland is observed during the winter months, specifically in January or February. This is when the number of cases reaches its highest point. On the other hand, the trough period occurs during the summer months, particularly from June to August, when very few or no cases are reported.

Overall Trends:
There has been a fluctuating trend in the number of cases of human H7N9 virus infection in Chinese mainland. From 2013 to 2017, there was an increasing trend in the number of cases, with the highest number of cases reported in 2017. However, since 2018, there has been a significant decline in the number of cases, with no cases reported from 2018 to 2023.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal patterns suggest that the transmission of the H7N9 virus is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, which are known to impact the virus's survival and spread. The peak period during the winter months may be attributed to the colder temperatures, which favor the survival and transmission of the virus. Conversely, the trough period during the summer months may be due to higher temperatures and increased sunlight, which are less favorable for the virus.

The overall declining trend in case numbers since 2018 is encouraging and may be attributed to various factors, including improved surveillance and control measures implemented by public health authorities, as well as increased public awareness and adherence to preventive measures. However, it is crucial to remain vigilant and continue monitoring the situation, as the virus may still pose a threat in the future.

It should be noted that this analysis is based on the provided data. Additional information, such as population size and demographic factors, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of the H7N9 virus in Chinese mainland.

## Introduction

Human infection with H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013, concerning public health authorities due to its potential pandemic risk. This avian influenza A virus primarily affects birds, but sporadic transmission to humans has been reported, often resulting in severe respiratory illness. Infected individuals typically have exposure history to live poultry or contaminated environments. Human-to-human transmission is rare. Symptoms range from mild conjunctivitis to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Management is primarily supportive, with antiviral medications like neuraminidase inhibitors being used for treatment. Surveillance and control measures focus on minimizing human exposure to affected birds.

## Highlights

- The H7N9 virus saw its peak in human infection cases and deaths in Chinese mainland between January and March of 2017, with a high case-fatality rate. <br/>
- After a significant drop post-2017, no human cases or deaths have been observed since April 2023, indicating effective control or possible underreporting. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns indicate that the majority of cases occurred in the winter and early spring, consistent with other influenza viruses. <br/>
- The ongoing absence of cases may suggest successful public health interventions, such as poultry market closures and improved surveillance. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The incidence of human H7N9 infection in Chinese mainland features a marked seasonality with significant peaks during winter months, especially from January to April, coinciding with increased human-animal interaction and colder weather conducive to the virus's survival. Cases surged notably in early 2014, with January and February 2017 experiencing the highest recorded incidences, followed by sharp declines. Since mid-2017, reported cases have nearly ceased, which could be attributed to enhanced surveillance, improved disease control measures in poultry populations, and greater public awareness of the risks associated with live animal markets.

### Deaths Analysis

The mortality associated with the H7N9 virus followed a similar seasonal pattern as observed with the cases. The fatality rate was alarmingly high during the early years, peaking conspicuously in February 2017. Subsequently, the number of reported deaths dropped to zero and remained so from mid-2017 onwards. This drastic improvement could reflect advancements in medical management, early detection of cases, and effective response strategies. The absence of data on severe and mild cases precludes precise calculation of the case-fatality rate; however, the high number of deaths in the context of the total cases suggests a severe disease progression in confirmed cases.

Seasonal Patterns:
The data provided indicates a clear seasonal pattern for cases of Leptospirosis in Chinese mainland. The highest number of cases occurs during the summer months (June, July, and August), while the lowest number occurs during the winter months (December, January, and February). This suggests a higher risk of contracting Leptospirosis during warmer months.

Peak and Trough Periods:
In Chinese mainland, the peak period for Leptospirosis cases is in August, with a peak value of 110 cases in 2020. The lowest point, or trough period, occurs in January and February, with the lowest values being -10 cases in 2013. These peak and trough periods indicate the highest and lowest levels of Leptospirosis activity throughout the year.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there is an increasing trend in the number of Leptospirosis cases in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023. Although there are fluctuations from year to year, there is a general upward trend, indicating an increasing incidence of Leptospirosis over time.

Discussion:
The seasonal pattern of Leptospirosis cases in Chinese mainland suggests a higher risk of infection during the summer months, aligning with the known transmission dynamics of the disease. Leptospirosis is typically transmitted through contact with water contaminated by the urine of infected animals, and warmer weather conditions may enhance the survival and spread of the bacteria.

The peak period in August may be attributed to increased outdoor activities and exposure to contaminated water sources during the summer season. Conversely, the lower number of cases during the winter months may be due to reduced outdoor activities and limited contact with contaminated water sources.

The overall increasing trend in Leptospirosis cases calls for continued surveillance and preventive measures to control the spread of the disease. Public health interventions, such as improving sanitation and hygiene practices, raising awareness about the risks of Leptospirosis, and implementing targeted control measures during peak periods, can help decrease the incidence of the disease in Chinese mainland.

## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. It is caused by the bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Infection typically occurs through exposure to water contaminated with the urine of infected animals or through direct contact with their tissues or bodily fluids. The bacteria can penetrate the body through cuts in the skin or mucous membranes. Symptoms range from mild flu-like manifestations to severe illness with organ failure. Without proper treatment, leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death. Vaccines are available for at-risk animals but not for humans.

## Highlights

- Seasonal pattern identified, with peak incidence occurring between July and October, consistent with the rainy season conducive to the spread of Leptospira in water and soil. <br/>
- A steady decline in both cases and deaths is observed over the 13-year period, indicating effective public health interventions and possibly improved diagnostics, treatment, and prevention measures. <br/>
- Sporadic fluctuations in case numbers possibly reflect localized outbreaks, underscoring the need for targeted surveillance and ongoing risk management in endemic areas. <br/>
- The most recent data from October 2023 shows a continuation of the endemic presence of leptospirosis, with 76 cases and no deaths reported, which suggests that fatality rates are being controlled. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Leptospirosis incidence in Chinese mainland exhibits a clear seasonal pattern, with case numbers incrementing during the warmer months, from May to October, indicating a potential link with seasonal activities and environmental factors that favor bacterial transmission. Over the years, a noticeable peak often occurs between August and October. However, annual variations are apparent, with some years like 2012 and 2013 showing particularly high numbers. Notably, cases remain low during the winter months, underscoring the influence of climate on disease spread.

### Deaths Analysis

Fatalities resulting from Leptospirosis in China are sporadic and low in number. The data reveals months with heightened case counts not necessarily correlating with increased deaths, suggesting effective clinical interventions or variable pathogenicity. The mortality rate is not constant, with years like 2010 seeing higher death peaks in September and October. Despite fluctuations, there appears to be no significant upward trend in deaths, indicating a possibly stable case fatality rate throughout the observed period.

Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the available data, there is a clear seasonal pattern in the incidence of measles cases in mainland China. Measles cases are most prevalent during the spring and summer months (March to August) and least common during the winter months (December to February). This recurring seasonal trend is consistent across multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The highest number of measles cases in mainland China occur during the months of May and June, representing the peak period. Conversely, the lowest number of cases, or trough period, is observed in December and January.

Overall Trends: 
There has been a gradual decrease in the number of measles cases in mainland China over the years. From 2010 to 2013, a downward trend was evident. However, there was a notable increase in cases from 2013 to 2015, followed by another decrease from 2015 to 2018. Since 2018, the number of cases has remained relatively low and stable.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal pattern of measles cases in mainland China aligns with the known transmission dynamics of the disease. Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily in densely populated areas, which are more common during warmer months when people spend more time outdoors and in close proximity to one another.

Various factors contribute to the peak period in May and June, including increased travel and social gatherings during holidays and school breaks. These factors may facilitate the transmission of the virus among susceptible individuals. Conversely, reduced social interactions and heightened awareness of preventive measures during the winter season likely contribute to the trough period in December and January.

The overall decline in measles cases over the years can be attributed to successful vaccination campaigns and improved public health measures in mainland China. Implementation of measles vaccination programs has resulted in increased immunity and reduced transmission of the virus. However, it is crucial to maintain high vaccination coverage and continue monitoring the situation to prevent future outbreaks.

It is important to note that the provided data relates solely to measles cases and deaths. To gain a comprehensive understanding of measles epidemiology in mainland China, additional information such as vaccination coverage, age distribution of cases, and geographic variations would be invaluable.

## Introduction

Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Monkeypox virus, part of the Poxviridae family and related to the now-eradicated smallpox virus. It is typically transmitted to humans from animals, with rodents being the most common source. The virus can spread through direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or skin lesions of an infected animal or human, or through respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face interaction. Common symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and a distinctive rash resembling that of smallpox. Monkeypox generally has a milder clinical course than smallpox.

## Highlights

- A noticeable increase in monkeypox cases in mainland China from September to October 2023, with reported cases rising from 80 to 127, indicating a growing transmission within the population. <br/>
- Despite the rise in cases, the reported death toll has remained at zero, suggesting that while the infection is spreading, it may be managed effectively, and the health system is currently able to cope with the severity of the infections. <br/>
- The trend from September to October shows a 58.75% increase in cases, which could imply that the virus is becoming more transmissible or that awareness and testing have improved, leading to more cases being identified and reported. <br/>
- The absence of mortality might indicate either the presence of a less virulent strain, good access to medical care, or a successful public health response including vaccination, if available, and other control measures. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From September to October 2023, mainland China reported a 58.75% increase in monkeypox cases, from 80 to 127 cases respectively. This suggests an escalating transmission rate, which may be attributed to several factors such as increased human-to-human transmission, enhanced surveillance and reporting, or the arrival of new cases from international travel. The uptick indicates potential communal spread, highlighting the need for prompt public health interventions to contain the virus and prevent sustained chains of transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the rise in reported monkeypox cases during September and October 2023 in mainland China, there have been no recorded deaths. This demonstrates that while the infection is spreading, it has not resulted in fatalities within these months. The absence of mortality could reflect the virus's typically low death rate, effective health care response, or a strain of the virus with lower lethality. Ongoing medical support and monitoring are required to manage complications and minimize the risk of potential future fatalities.

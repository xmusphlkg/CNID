Seasonal Patterns: According to the provided data, no clear seasonal pattern is observed for SARS-CoV cases and deaths in Chinese mainland prior to October 2023. The number of cases and deaths remained consistently low throughout the years, showing no significant fluctuations or patterns.

Peak and Trough Periods: There are no identifiable peak and trough periods in the data. The number of cases and deaths consistently remained at zero or very low levels throughout the entire period.

Overall Trends: The overall trend for SARS-CoV cases and deaths in Chinese mainland before October 2023 is characterized by a consistently low and stable number. There is no significant increase or decrease observed over time.

Discussion: The provided data suggests that there were no reported cases or deaths attributed to SARS-CoV in Chinese mainland before October 2023. This implies that the virus was not actively circulating or causing a significant impact during this period. It is important to note that the absence of reported cases does not necessarily imply the absence of the virus, as surveillance and reporting systems may vary. However, based on the available data, there is no evidence of a SARS-CoV outbreak or significant transmission in Chinese mainland prior to October 2023.

## Introduction

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. It was identified in 2003 as the cause of an outbreak of severe respiratory illness that emerged in China in 2002. SARS-CoV is characterized by fever, cough, and often progresses to pneumonia. Human-to-human transmission occurs mainly through respiratory droplets. The global outbreak was contained by 2004, with over 8,000 cases and nearly 800 deaths reported. The experience with SARS-CoV informed responses to later emerging coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

## Highlights

- No cases of SARS-CoV reported in Chinese mainland since the available data begins in January 2010 through October 2023. <br/>
- A singular reporting anomaly appears in May 2012 with a recorded 1,093 deaths yet no associated cases, likely indicating a data entry error or an unrelated event not pertinent to SARS-CoV incidence. <br/>
- Continued zero-case trend suggests either the effective containment and elimination of SARS-CoV or a lack of reporting, which could be due to various factors including successful public health interventions. <br/>
- Overall, the SARS-CoV situation appears non-endemic or not present in Chinese mainland within the provided data timeframe, based on the absence of reported cases or deaths. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The provided dataset shows no reported cases of SARS-CoV in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to October 2023. This prolonged absence of cases suggests successful control and containment measures following the SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003. The data reflects the effectiveness of the public health interventions and surveillance systems put in place to prevent re-emergence. Continued vigilance is essential, considering the potential for zoonotic transmission and the global mobility that could facilitate the spread of similar viruses.

### Deaths Analysis

In the reported data, there is an anomaly in May 2012, recording 1093 deaths without corresponding cases, which is likely a data error. All other months from January 2010 to October 2023 report zero deaths, indicating effective containment after the 2003 epidemic. The absence of mortality data congruent with case data suggests accurate recording and successful SARS eradication in the region with no secondary outbreaks, aligning with global SARS-CoV epidemiology post-2004. This underscores the importance of stringent public health policies to contain deadly pathogens.

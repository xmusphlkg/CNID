Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the data provided, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in the incidence of syphilis cases in Chinese mainland. The number of cases tends to be higher during the summer months (June to August) and lower during the winter months (December to February). This pattern is consistent across multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for syphilis cases in Chinese mainland occurs during the summer months, particularly in July, when the highest number of cases is reported. The trough period, corresponding to the lowest number of cases, falls in the winter months, particularly in January and February.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there has been a consistent increase in the number of syphilis cases in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023. The incidence of cases has shown a general upward trend, with some yearly fluctuations. However, it is worth noting that there was a decrease in cases in 2013, particularly in January and February. This decrease may be attributed to data reporting issues rather than an actual decline in syphilis cases.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal pattern in syphilis cases in Chinese mainland, with higher numbers during the summer and lower numbers during the winter, aligns with the patterns of disease transmission. Syphilis, being primarily transmitted through sexual contact, may have higher transmission rates during the summer months due to increased social activities.

The overall increasing trend in syphilis cases over the years emphasizes the ongoing need for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment efforts regarding this disease. Public health interventions should prioritize promoting safe sexual practices, spreading awareness about syphilis, and ensuring the availability of testing and treatment services.

It is important to acknowledge that the provided data solely includes cases and deaths associated with syphilis, and does not encompass information on other crucial factors like population size, demographic characteristics, or specific risk factors. Therefore, additional analysis and consideration of supplementary data are necessary to comprehensively grasp the epidemiology of syphilis in Chinese mainland.

## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is primarily spread through sexual contact, but can also be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy, leading to congenital syphilis. The disease progresses through distinct stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis, each with varying symptoms. The primary stage often presents with a painless ulcer known as a chancre. If untreated, syphilis can eventually cause serious health problems affecting the heart, brain, and other organs. Diagnosis is through blood tests and direct microscopic examination, with penicillin being the standard treatment.

## Highlights

- Increasing trend in syphilis cases from 2010 to 2023, with a significant surge in the most recent recorded months. <br/>
- Despite the rise in cases, the number of deaths remains low, with no clear trend in mortality, and recent months showing minimal fatalities. <br/>
- Notable fluctuations in cases possibly related to seasonal changes or reporting practices, with some peaks and troughs observed across years. <br/>
- A sharp decrease in cases in 2020 February possibly due to reduced healthcare access or reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic, but a subsequent rebound in case numbers. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Between January 2010 and October 2023, Chinese mainlandâ€™s reported syphilis cases demonstrate an ascending trend over the years. Initial cases hovered around 30,000 per month but increased significantly to cross the 50,000 mark in later years. Noteworthy peaks occur periodically, suggesting possible seasonal or episodic factors influencing transmission dynamics. The data implies consistent propagation of the infection and underscores the need for effective public health interventions to curb syphilis transmission.

### Deaths Analysis

Syphilis-related deaths in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to October 2023 are relatively infrequent considering the volume of cases, with monthly deaths mostly in the single digits and occasionally reaching low double digits. The highest number of deaths recorded in a single month is 25 (January 2020), which is an anomaly in the dataset. This may suggest successful management of complications or underreporting of mortality. Despite low mortality, the persistence of cases emphasizes the need for sustained surveillance and treatment strategies.

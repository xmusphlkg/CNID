Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the provided data, there is a clear seasonal pattern for both Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in Chinese mainland. The number of cases tends to increase during the summer months (June to August) and decrease during the winter months (December to February). This pattern consistently occurs over multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for both Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in Chinese mainland is typically observed in the summer months, specifically in July and August. During these months, the number of cases reaches its highest point. Conversely, the trough period, when the number of cases is at its lowest, is usually seen in the winter months, particularly in December and January.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there is a decreasing trend in the number of cases for both Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023. The number of cases fluctuates from year to year, but there is a general downward trend. This suggests that efforts to control and prevent these diseases have been effective.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal patterns in the data indicate that Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in Chinese mainland are influenced by environmental factors that are more favorable for disease transmission during the summer months. This could be attributed to increased rainfall, higher temperatures, and changes in human behavior, such as increased travel and outdoor activities.

The peak periods in July and August coincide with the summer season, when conditions are most conducive to the spread of these diseases. It is crucial for public health authorities to be aware of this seasonal pattern and implement targeted interventions, such as improved sanitation and hygiene practices, vaccination campaigns, and public awareness efforts, to prevent and control the spread of Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever during these peak periods.

The overall decreasing trend in the number of cases over time suggests that public health measures and interventions have effectively reduced the burden of these diseases in Chinese mainland. This could be attributed to improvements in sanitation and hygiene practices, increased access to clean water, and vaccination programs. However, it is important to continue monitoring and implementing preventive measures to sustain this downward trend and further reduce the incidence of Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in the future.

It is worth noting that there are some inconsistencies in the data, such as negative values for cases and deaths in certain months. These inconsistencies could be due to data entry errors or other factors. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data when conducting epidemiological analyses.

## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are infectious diseases caused by the bacteria Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, respectively. Both conditions are characterized by high fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, and headache, and are transmitted through contaminated food and water. Untreated, they can lead to serious complications and be fatal. Although they share similar symptoms, they are distinct entities often lumped together as enteric fevers due to their shared transmission routes and clinical features. Vaccination, improved sanitation, and antibiotics are crucial for prevention and treatment.

## Highlights

- A gradual decline in reported cases of Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers from 2010 to 2023, with a notable decrease from 2010 (peak at 1867 cases in August) to 2023 (480 cases in October). <br/>
- Mortality remained rare throughout the observed period, with some years such as 2017 and 2020 witnessing a small spike in deaths (3 and 2, respectively). <br/>
- The lowest recorded number of cases occurred in December 2022 with 234 cases, suggesting an effective reduction in disease incidence over the years. <br/>
- Through October 2023, there is a consistent trend of lower caseloads during winter months compared to summer months, indicating seasonality in transmission dynamics. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

From 2010 to 2023, Chinese mainland saw a consistent pattern of typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases. Cases peaked during the summer months, reflecting seasonal trends associated with these diseases. There was a conspicuous decline in reported cases beginning in 2020, continuing into 2023. This could be attributed to public health measures for COVID-19, which may also impact food and waterborne illnesses. A gradual increase post-2020 suggests a return to prior transmission levels, yet numbers remain below the decade's earlier figures.

### Deaths Analysis

Throughout the 2010-2023 period, deaths associated with typhoid and paratyphoid fevers in Chinese mainland were remarkably low, despite fluctuating case numbers. Deaths occasionally spiked (e.g., June 2017) but remained sporadic without evident seasonality or increasing trend over time. The low mortality rate could indicate effective clinical management or reporting practices; however, sporadic increases in deaths warrant epidemiological investigations to ensure maintained clinical vigilance and public health readiness.

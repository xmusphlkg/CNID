## Introduction

Dysentery is an inflammatory disease of the intestine, especially of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing blood and mucus in the feces. It can be caused by several types of infectious pathogens such as bacteria (Shigella), protozoa (Entamoeba histolytica), parasitic worms, or viruses. The condition is typically spread through contaminated food or water. Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, and urgent need to defecate. Dysentery can be life-threatening, especially in vulnerable populations like young children and the elderly, if not treated appropriately with hydration and, in the case of bacterial dysentery, antibiotics.

- Despite the controlled number of cases, sporadic peaks are evident (e.g., August 2010 with 41,507 cases), signaling potential outbreaks during specific periods.<br/>
- The disease showcased a seasonal trend, with most cases appearing from May to August each year, indicating a possible link to seasonal factors. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Over the period from 2010 through 2023, reported cases of Dysentery in Chinese mainland generally followed a seasonal trend, with the highest numbers typically observed from May to September. The peak was in August 2010 with 41,507 reported cases. Despite the seasonal spikes the general trend over these 13 years indicates a decline in reported cases. The highest annual caseload was in 2010 with 225,245 cases, whereas 2023 (until September) saw 28,088 cases indicating a significant decrease in dysentery prevalence.

### Deaths Analysis

The number of deaths due to dysentery displayed significant variance, with most months reporting very few fatalities, exceptions being 198 deaths in September 2012 being the highest. Generally, despite variations in the number of cases, the death rates have remained relatively low, suggesting effective medical management of the disease. Besides, a declining number of cases over the years led to fewer deaths overall, reinforcing successful disease control measures in place in Chinese mainland.

Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in cases of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) in mainland China. The number of cases tends to be higher between June and September, with a peak in September. This is followed by a decrease in cases from October to February, with the lowest occurrence in January and February. From March to May, there is a slight increase in cases before the peak season resumes in June.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
Typically, the highest number of EHF cases in mainland China is observed in September, making it the peak period. Conversely, the lowest occurrence of cases, known as the trough period, is usually seen in January and February.

Overall Trends: 
Overall, there is an upward trend in the number of EHF cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. While the number of cases fluctuates from year to year, some years experiencing higher peaks than others, there is a general increase over time.

Discussion: 
The observed seasonal patterns suggest that there may be specific environmental or climatic factors contributing to the spread of EHF in mainland China. The peak in summer cases could be attributed to factors like increased mosquito activity or higher temperatures, which may facilitate disease transmission.

The continuous increase in the number of cases highlights the urgency for ongoing surveillance and control measures to prevent further spread of the disease. Public health authorities must closely monitor the situation and implement suitable interventions to reduce the burden of EHF in mainland China.

It is important to note that the interpretation of the data may be limited without graphical representation or statistical analysis. To validate the observed patterns and trends, it is recommended to conduct further analysis using appropriate statistical methods.

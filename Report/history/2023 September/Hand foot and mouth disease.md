Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, a distinct seasonal pattern for Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in mainland China is apparent. The number of cases shows a consistent increase during the spring and summer months, reaching its highest point between May and July. This is followed by a gradual decrease during the fall and winter months, with the lowest activity occurring between December and February.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for HFMD cases in mainland China commonly falls between May and July, with the highest number of cases being reported during this time. Conversely, the trough period, characterized by the least number of cases, typically spans from December to February.

Overall Trends: 
From 2010 to 2023, mainland China has experienced an overall upward trend in the incidence of HFMD cases. While the number of cases fluctuates from year to year, some years exhibiting higher peaks than others, an overall increase is evident over time.

Discussion: 
The observed seasonal pattern of HFMD in mainland China aligns with the recognized characteristics of the disease. HFMD is known to be more prevalent during warmer months due to the thriving conditions for causative viruses, such as enterovirus, in warm and humid environments. The peak period of HFMD cases in May to July coincides with the summer season, which is characterized by elevated temperatures.

The overall rise in HFMD cases over the years can be attributed to several factors, including improved surveillance and reporting systems, increased awareness and diagnosis of the disease, population growth, and changes in environmental and socioeconomic factors. It is important to note that the provided data only includes cases and deaths documented before September 2023, thus further analysis is necessary to evaluate the influence of interventions and public health measures on disease trends.

Moreover, it is noteworthy that negative values are present in some months, particularly in the early years. These negative values may indicate data reporting issues or inconsistencies and should be investigated further to ensure accuracy.

In conclusion, the data suggests a distinct seasonal pattern with peak HFMD activity observed in the spring and summer months in mainland China. The overall trend reveals a progressive increase in HFMD cases, emphasizing the importance of ongoing surveillance and preventive measures to control disease transmission.

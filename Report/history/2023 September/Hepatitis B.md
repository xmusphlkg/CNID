## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is a major global health problem, leading to acute and chronic disease that can result in liver cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. The virus is transmitted through contact with blood or other body fluids of an infected person. A safe and effective vaccine can prevent Hepatitis B, and it is commonly given as part of childhood vaccination programs. While acute infections may be mild or symptom-free, chronic Hepatitis B can cause long-term health issues and requires medical management.

## Highlights

- There has been a general decrease in the number of Hepatitis B cases in China from 2010 to 2023, with minor fluctuations.<br/>
- Despite some spikes such as in March and August 2023 with 126,932 and 138,875 cases respectively, the overall trend suggests effective disease control methods.<br/>
- Mortality rates have remained relatively low throughout all years, signifying good patient management.<br/>
- As of September 2023, the situation appears to be under control with a decline in the number of cases and deaths (123,495 and 20, respectively).<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The data indicates fluctuating numbers of Hepatitis B cases in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to September 2023. The lowest was in December 2022 with 59498 cases while the peak was noted in August 2023 with 138875 cases. Though there were some periods with decline, there is an overall upward trend in the later years, notably starting from 2016. This upward trajectory suggests an increased rate of transmission or possibly improved disease surveillance and diagnosis.

### Deaths Analysis

The death toll due to Hepatitis B varied from a low of 12 in May 2012 up to a high of 80 in January 2020. Despite minor fluctuations, the mortality remained relatively stable throughout the period. The number of deaths does not appear to directly correlate with the number of diagnoses, suggesting effective management of the disease. However, the fluctuations may indicate varying treatment success rates, the virulence of the virus, or other health interventions. Despite the steady mortality rate, the increasing caseload suggests an urgent need for effective disease prevention.

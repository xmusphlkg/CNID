Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, a clear seasonal pattern can be observed in the number of measles cases in mainland China. The number of cases is highest during the spring and summer months (March to August) and lowest during the fall and winter months (September to February). This pattern remains consistent across multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for measles cases in mainland China is observed in May and June, recording the highest number of cases. The trough period, which represents the lowest number of cases, typically occurs in December and January.

Overall Trends: 
There has been a consistent decrease in the number of measles cases in mainland China over the years. From 2010 to 2013, there was a gradual decline in cases. However, there was a significant increase from 2013 to 2015, followed by a sharp decline in 2016. Since then, the number of cases has remained relatively low with occasional fluctuations.

Discussion: 
The observed seasonal pattern of measles cases in mainland China aligns with the known transmission dynamics of the disease. Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily in crowded environments, which may explain the higher number of cases during the spring and summer months when people tend to gather in public spaces.

The peak period in May and June can be attributed to various factors, including increased travel and social activities during the summer months, which facilitate the spread of the virus. Additionally, the trough period in December and January may be influenced by reduced social interactions and increased awareness and implementation of preventive measures during the winter season.

The overall decreasing trend in measles cases can be attributed to successful vaccination campaigns and improved public health measures. Measles vaccination coverage has increased in mainland China, reducing the number of susceptible individuals and subsequently limiting the transmission of the virus.

It is important to note that the provided data only encompasses cases and deaths resulting from measles, without considering the impact of vaccination programs and other control measures. Further analysis and consideration of additional factors like vaccination coverage, population demographics, and public health interventions would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the trends and patterns of measles in mainland China.

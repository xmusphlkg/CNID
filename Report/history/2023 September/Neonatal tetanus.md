## Introduction

Neonatal tetanus is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns. It typically results from infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the umbilical cord is cut with a non-sterile instrument. The disease is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which releases a neurotoxin leading to muscle stiffness and spasms. Without prompt treatment, neonatal tetanus can be fatal due to respiratory failure. It is largely preventable through immunization of the pregnant mother with tetanus toxoid vaccine, which confers passive immunity to the infant.

## Highlights

- There is a significant decrease in the number of cases and deaths from Neonatal tetanus in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023. <br/>
- Monthly case numbers in 2010 fluctuated around 100, but by 2023, they were more often than not under 5 cases a month. <br/>
- The number of fatalities also saw a notable drop, with no reported deaths in recent years since 2018. <br/>
- The overall trend indicates effective control and prevention measures against Neonatal tetanus in Chinese mainland.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The data suggests a significant reduction in neonatal tetanus cases over the period from 2010 through 2023. In 2010, cases numbered in the high double digits, reaching a peak of 120 in both September and October. This reduced significantly over the years; by 2020, monthly cases were reported in the low single digits, and by 2022-2023, only 1-6 cases were reported monthly. This substantial decrease may be attributed to increased vaccination rates and better hygiene practices in healthcare facilities.

### Deaths Analysis

Deaths from neonatal tetanus also appear to decrease over time. Highs of 12 deaths were reported in early 2010, but by 2020, there were months with no recorded deaths. By 2022 and into 2023, only one death was reported in this period. This is likely due to advances in medical treatments, increased access to these treatments, and the overall reduction of cases. However, neonatal tetanus still poses a serious risk given its high mortality rate, particularly in locations with limited access to appropriate healthcare services.

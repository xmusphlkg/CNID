Seasonal Patterns: 
According to the data, there is a discernible seasonal pattern for Pertussis cases in mainland China. The number of cases is higher during the summer and fall, specifically from June to September, and lower during the winter and spring, from December to April. This pattern remains consistent across multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for Pertussis cases in mainland China is during July and August, with the highest number of cases reported during this time. The trough period, or the lowest number of cases, is observed in the winter months, particularly January and February.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there is an increasing trend in Pertussis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. The number of cases gradually increased from 88 in January 2010 to a peak of 4793 in August 2023. However, there are fluctuations in the number of cases throughout the years, with some periods showing relatively stable or decreasing cases.

Discussion:
The seasonal pattern of Pertussis cases in mainland China suggests that the disease is more prevalent during the summer and fall, which aligns with the known transmission dynamics of Pertussis. The peak period in July and August may be influenced by factors such as increased social interactions and travel during the summer season.

The overall increasing trend in Pertussis cases over the years may be attributed to various factors, including changes in surveillance and reporting systems, increased awareness and testing for Pertussis, population growth, and changes in vaccination coverage. It is important to note that the provided data only includes cases and deaths before September 2023, and further analysis would be necessary to assess the impact of interventions and changes in disease dynamics beyond this period.

It is crucial for public health authorities to continue monitoring Pertussis cases and implementing preventive measures, such as vaccination programs and public awareness campaigns, to control the spread of the disease and reduce its burden on the population.

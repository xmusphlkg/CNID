## Introduction

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Characterized by severe coughing fits that can end in a "whooping" sound when the person breathes in, the disease can affect individuals of all ages but is particularly dangerous for infants. Vaccination offers effective protection, yet outbreaks still occur, indicating the need for continued vigilance. Pertussis is transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing, and its initial symptoms resemble those of a common cold, followed by a more severe coughing phase.

## Highlights

- Pertussis cases in Chinese mainland show a fluctuating pattern over time, with dramatic increases during certain periods, such as between 2013-2015 and 2017-2019. <br/>
- Despite annual fluctuations, a general upward trend is observed from 2010 to 2023, indicating a progressively worsening situation. <br/>
- The data suggests seasonality, with case counts typically peaking during the summer months (June-August) year after year. <br/>
- There is a low number of reported deaths, showing that whilst the disease is widespread, it is not commonly fatal. However, fatalities are inconsistently reported, inferring an unpredictable severity trend. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The reported cases of Pertussis in Chinese mainland show a fluctuating but generally increasing trend over time. The data for the successive years indicate that the number of cases tends to peak during the summer months, particularly in August. This seasonality may be due to climatic factors conducive to the spread of the disease. The years 2022 and 2023 witnessed a substantial increase in the cases, with August 2022 having the highest number (5355 cases).

### Deaths Analysis

The mortality rate from Pertussis remains relatively low, given the total number of cases reported throughout the years. The data shows sporadic instances of death (only 13 reported in the span of thirteen years), suggesting effective detection and treatment by health officials. Most deaths occurred in the second half of the year, probably due to the high number of infections during those months. However, despite the increasing cases in 2022-2023, the number of deaths did not show a proportional rise, indicating improvements in medical responses.

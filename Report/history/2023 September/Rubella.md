## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German measles, is a contagious viral infection best known for its distinctive red rash. It's caused by the rubella virus, which is transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. While often mild in children and adults, rubella infection during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, can lead to serious congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the fetus, resulting in multiple birth defects and developmental issues. Since the development of the rubella vaccine, occurrences have greatly diminished in countries where the vaccine is widely administered.

## Highlights

- The data shows a consistent pattern of Rubella cases peaking between March and June every year, and declining significantly towards later months. <br/>
- Overall, the number of Rubella cases in Chinese mainland has been on a steady decline from 2010 to 2023. <br/>
- The number of deaths caused by Rubella remains extremely low, with only a few instances of fatalities recorded between 2010 and 2023. <br/>
- As of September 2023, the number of Rubella cases remains low at 72, with zero recorded deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Rubella cases in Chinese mainland demonstrate significant temporal fluctuations. The data shows a distinct pattern, with case numbers peaking between March and June every year, and notably in April. The highest number of cases (18445) occurred in May 2011, while the lowest (40) in January 2023. Over the 13-year period, there is a clear trend of decreasing incidence rates, with the highest concentrations of cases occurring between 2010-2012, and numbers generally decreasing from 2013 onwards. This suggests progress in disease control efforts, which could be attributed to various causes, including improved immunization coverage.

### Deaths Analysis

The mortality rate from Rubella in Chinese mainland is remarkably low, with only five reported deaths between 2010 and 2022, during periods of high case numbers. This demonstrates that, while Rubella may have a high infection rate during certain periods, its virulence in terms of mortality remains relatively low. This low lethality rate can be attributed to effective disease management strategies in Chinese mainland, including access to healthcare and treatment. Similarly to the case numbers, deaths also largely decreased over the observed period, indicating effective public health interventions.

## Introduction

Typhus is an acute, febrile illness caused by several species of Rickettsia bacteria, transmitted to humans through arthropod vectors like lice, fleas, or mites. It presents with symptoms such as high fever, headache, chills, and a distinctive rash. Historically, outbreaks were associated with poor hygiene and crowding, often in wartime and disaster conditions. It is primarily diagnosed using serologic tests and treated effectively with antibiotics such as doxycycline. Preventative measures include improving sanitation, reducing contact with vectors, and using insect repellents or insecticide-treated clothing. There are three main types: epidemic typhus, endemic (murine) typhus, and scrub typhus.

## Highlights

1. A general decline in the number of Typhus cases per month has been observed in Chinese mainland between 2010 and 2023, with a few exceptions.<br/>
2. Despite the decreasing number of cases, there have been some increases around May to September each year in this period, suggesting a potential seasonal pattern to the disease's prevalence.<br/>
3. Notably, there have been very few deaths as a result of Typhus in all these years, implying a high recovery rate, efficient treatment methods, or low disease severity.<br/>
4. As of September 2023, there were 227 reported cases with no fatalities, which is a slight increase compared to previous years' data within the same month.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

From January 2010 to September 2023, there were peaks and troughs in the number of confirmed cases of Typhus reported in Chinese mainland. A spike in cases was often reported in summer and autumn months, which might be due to favorable conditions for the vector in this period. A significant decrease in confirmed cases was experienced between the years 2010 to 2023, suggesting an effective intervention strategy in place, such as mass vaccination or improved sanitation measures.

### Deaths Analysis

Throughout this 13-year span, recorded deaths from Typhus remained remarkably low, reporting only a handful of instances (June 2010, May 2011, June 2014, August 2015, September 2016). This low mortality rate may indicate effective treatment regimens and prompt medical care, thus minimizing fatal outcomes. However, it is essential to investigate any unreported deaths or untreated cases in rural areas to ensure comprehensive epidemic management.

In September 2023, mainland China exhibited distinct patterns and trends in disease cases and deaths.

1. Overall Disease Cases: In September 2023, there were a total of 879,567 disease cases, reflecting a 19.54% increase compared to August 2023, and a significant decrease of 80.86% compared to September 2022. This significant decline can be attributed to the successful implementation of control and prevention measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. Disease-Specific Patterns:

- Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis: There was a substantial increase in cases of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in September compared to both the previous month (883.08%) and the same period in 2022 (5410.95%), indicating a significant outbreak of this disease.

- Anthrax: The number of anthrax cases exhibited a decrease of 50.41% compared to August 2023, but an increase of 45.24% compared to September 2022. This suggests a fluctuating trend in anthrax cases.

- Brucellosis: September witnessed a decline of 28.33% in cases compared to August 2023, but an increase of 12.73% compared to September 2022. This indicates that efforts to control brucellosis have been effective, but further attention is required.

- Cholera: The number of cholera cases slightly increased by 12.50% compared to August 2023, and significantly increased by 125.00% compared to September 2022. This highlights the need for enhanced prevention and control measures for cholera.

- Dengue: There was a notable increase in dengue cases in September 2023 compared to both August 2023 (54.69%) and September 2022 (23092.86%), indicating a significant outbreak of dengue in mainland China.

- Hepatitis: While there was a decrease in cases of hepatitis A, B, and E compared to previous months, September 2023 recorded an increase in hepatitis C cases compared to August 2023 (6.84%) and September 2022 (348.57%). This suggests an ongoing challenge in managing hepatitis C infections.

- Tuberculosis: September 2023 witnessed a decrease in tuberculosis cases compared to August 2023 (-7.07%), but an increase compared to September 2022 (5.49%). This indicates the need for continued efforts in tuberculosis control and prevention.

3. Disease-Related Deaths: In September 2023, the total number of deaths was 2,213, exhibiting a decrease of 7.79% compared to August 2023, and a decrease of 3.45% compared to September 2022.

- Hepatitis: While there were reductions in deaths related to hepatitis A, B, and E, there was an increase in deaths related to hepatitis C compared to August 2023 (5.99%) and September 2022 (122%).

- Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS): September 2023 saw a decrease in AIDS-related deaths compared to the previous month (-10.42%) and September 2022 (-8.34%). This could be attributed to improved treatment and management strategies for AIDS patients.

- Tuberculosis: There was an increase in deaths related to tuberculosis compared to August 2023 (6.93%), but a decrease compared to September 2022 (-6.63%). This indicates the need for continued efforts to reduce tuberculosis-related mortality.

In conclusion, the epidemiological data for September 2023 in mainland China reveals significant patterns and trends in disease occurrence and mortality. These include outbreaks of diseases such as acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and dengue, fluctuations in anthrax and brucellosis cases, and challenges in managing hepatitis C infections and tuberculosis. Additionally, there have been reductions in deaths related to hepatitis A, B, and E, AIDS, and tuberculosis. These findings underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance, prevention, and control measures to effectively address these diseases.

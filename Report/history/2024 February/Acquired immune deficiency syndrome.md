## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It damages the immune system, hindering the body's ability to fend off diseases. AIDS, the terminal stage of HIV, doesn't occur in all HIV-positive individuals. Without treatment, HIV may develop into AIDS, characterized by a severe fall in CD4 T cells or by specific associated diseases. However, modern antiretroviral therapy can effectively manage HIV, preventing its progression to AIDS.


## Highlights

- A significant rise in AIDS cases and deaths marked from 2014 to 2024, underlying a persistent HIV/AIDS epidemic in Chinese mainland. <br/>
- Seasonal peaks in new AIDS cases and associated deaths are consistent late in the year, with November and December being notably high. <br/>
- Annually, a noticeable decrease in cases and deaths happens around February, possibly due to Lunar New Year reporting disruptions. <br/>
- The latest data for February 2024 shows a small decrease in deaths from the prior month, yet the AIDS situation remains pressing with considerable case counts.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The number of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cases in Chinese mainland has shown a consistently high rate from February 2014 to February 2024. The lowest monthly case number was 1815 in January 2023, compared to the peak month December 2018 with 7897 cases. Throughout the ten years, most months recorded case numbers above 3000. There is a discernible trend of increasing cases towards the end of each year. Despite fluctuations, a general upward trend is perceivable across the decade, suggesting issues with ongoing HIV transmission and diagnosis.

### Deaths Analysis
The death count related to AIDS fluctuated, with the smallest number recorded as 624 in February 2015 and the highest as 2486 in December 2021. On average, the monthly death count seemed to stay mostly between 900 to 2000 range throughout the duration. Like the AIDS cases, there is a noticeable trend of high death rates at the very end of each year, which could reflect late diagnosis or treatment delays. The data shows an overall rising trend over the period, indicating a growing concern for health providers and policymakers.

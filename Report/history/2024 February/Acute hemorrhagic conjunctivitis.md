## Introduction

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a rapidly progressing and highly contagious viral infection of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the eye and eyelids. Typically caused by enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of pain, redness, swelling, tearing, and hemorrhage under the conjunctiva. Patients may also experience blurred vision and light sensitivity. Outbreaks often occur in crowded urban areas and can spread quickly, especially in tropical and subtropical climates. Despite its alarming presentation, the infection is usually self-limiting, resolving within one to two weeks without causing long-term ocular damage.

## Highlights

- Cases of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in China show seasonal peaks, usually in warmer months. However, a significant outbreak occurred in September 2023 with 125,264 cases. <br/>
- While case trends typically rise from February to September, 2023 witnessed an atypical September spike, suggesting outlier transmission or changes in reporting.<br/>
- The disease had mostly non-fatal outcomes except for isolated cases in 2019 and 2020.<br/>
- A decline followed the 2023 peak, suggesting outbreak control with a decrease to 1,856 cases by February 2024. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
In Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, cases of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis showed distinct seasonal influence with peaks usually observed during the summer months of June, July and August. Over the ten-year period, a general increasing trend in the cases reported was noticed, pointing towards the spreading prevalence of the disease. However, significant outliers were observed in 2023, with quantities of cases reported in September (125,264) drastically exceeding average incidences - suggesting a potential outbreak or changes in reporting methodology.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same ten-year period, a significant contrast in the number of deaths compared to the case incidence was noticed, with only 3 deaths in total reported, irrespective of the increasing trend of incidences. The first death recorded was in August 2019, followed by two deaths in February 2020. Subsequently, the mortality rate remained at zero despite the unprecedented spike in cases observed in 2023. The analysis indicates the high survivability of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis with effective medical intervention, despite the increasing prevalence in Chinese mainland.

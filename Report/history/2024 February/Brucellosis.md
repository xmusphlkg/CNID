## Introduction

Brucellosis, also known as Malta fever or undulant fever, is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacterial genus Brucella. It primarily affects various animals, including sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, and dogs. Humans can contract the disease through direct contact with infected animals, or by ingesting contaminated animal products, particularly unpasteurized milk or cheese. The bacterium induces a range of symptoms such as fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, muscle pain, and joint involvement. The infection can become chronic and may involve multiple organ systems, potentially leading to more severe complications if not appropriately treated.

## Highlights

- Despite occasional lulls, the overall trend of Brucellosis appears to be an increase in case numbers annually, with significant peaking occurring typically in the mid-year months.<br/>
- The disease's mortality rate remains incredibly low, rarely resulting in more than one death per month, and often none at all. This could indicate an effective management of the infection.<br/>
- Interestingly in the latest data from 2024, the case numbers have shown a noticeable decline compared to the previous year for the same period (February).<br/>
- Despite the recent drop, continuous vigilance and Proactive measures are paramount as Brucellosis remains significantly prevalent in mainland China.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The number of Brucellosis cases in the Chinese mainland showed a cyclical pattern annually, with a rise from the start of the year reaching a peak around mid-year, and then gradually decreasing towards the end of the year. The peak months seemed to cluster between May and August across all years. Interestingly, the highest number of cases was reported in June 2022, with 9943 cases. The annual total cases also displayed a general upward trend from 2014 through to 2024, suggesting a growing incidence of Brucellosis in Chinese mainland despite some fluctuations. 

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to Brucellosis throughout the years remained relatively low despite the growth in the number of cases. From the data, 99.9% of cases resulted in recovery, emphasizing how rarely Brucellosis is fatal. However, 2021 represented the year with the most deaths, totaling at 5. It's worth noting that deaths didn't follow the seasonal pattern observed in cases, suggesting that the timing of fatalities doesnâ€™t necessarily correlate with peak case incidence. In conclusion, while Brucellosis posed a growing health challenge in terms of morbidity, it is infrequently lethal.

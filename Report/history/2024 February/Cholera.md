## Introduction

Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Endemic to regions with inadequate water treatment, it is a global public health issue, primarily in developing countries. Symptoms include severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and, without prompt treatment, death within hours. Preventive measures include safe water, sanitation, and oral cholera vaccines. Treatment consists of oral rehydration solutions and, in severe cases, intravenous fluids and antibiotics.

## Highlights

- Cholera cases in mainland China peak during summer (July, August) and decline during cooler months.<br/>
- Incidence fluctuated in the observed period, with the highest in 2018 (12 cases); no clear overall trend is evident.<br/>
- No reported deaths suggest efficient disease management with local healthcare measures.<br/>
- As of February 2024, zero cases align with lower incidence in cooler months.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The analysis shows that Cholera cases in the Chinese mainland were sporadic since 2014 with no clear pattern of a pandemic outbreak. However, annual cases have slightly increased over time with the summers (June to October) often presenting a spike in cases. This is likely due to the cholera bacterium's preference for warm aquatic environments. In the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018, cases peaked especially during August. Notably, the year 2018 recorded the highest number of cases. Though negligible, the recorded infections show a subtle rising trend with mild cyclic episodes suggesting a need for increased vigilance.

### Deaths Analysis
The startling aspect of the cholera situation in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 is the absolute absence of fatality. Even with sporadic cases throughout a decade, no deaths have been reported. These findings infer a successful management and treatment strategy for cholera in the region, likely due to prompt medical attention and access to rehydration therapies. This zero-mortality rate suggests an effective public health response capable of swift case identification and management. Nonetheless, the persistent occurrence of cases underscores the continuing need for optimal surveillance, sanitation measures, and public awareness.

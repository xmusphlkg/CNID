## Introduction

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection causing a flu-like illness that can occasionally develop into a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue. The dengue virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes mainly of the species Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Ae. albopictus. These mosquitoes also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika infection. Dengue is widespread throughout the tropics, with local variations in risk influenced by rainfall, temperature, and unplanned rapid urbanization. There are four dengue viruses (DENV 1-4) that can cause dengue infection, and it is possible to be infected four times.

## Highlights

- There's an apparent seasonality in Dengue Fever cases in mainland China with peaks occurring around August to October every year. <br/>
- Since 2020, there's been a significant decrease in Dengue cases throughout the year. However, there was a drastic surge in cases in the mid-2023, indicating a potential outbreak. <br/>
- The mortality rate of Dengue remains relatively low with few recorded deaths despite fluctuating case numbers, demonstrating effective medical response. <br/>
- The situation in February 2024 shows 42 cases and no deaths, indicating an overall control of the disease, in comparison with the previous year's spike in cases during this period.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Dengue cases in Chinese mainland illustrate a marked seasonal pattern, with a significant increase in the warmer, rainy months of July through October, coinciding with the peak activity of mosquito vectors. Notably, 2014 saw an extraordinary surge, peaking in October with 28,796 cases. Subsequent years showed similar patterns but with fewer cases. A substantial decline in cases commenced in 2020, possibly due to public health interventions or reduced reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2023, cases rose again notably, with a peak of 6,494 in September.

### Deaths Analysis
Dengue-associated mortality in Chinese mainland has been relatively low despite high incidence in certain years. The highest number of deaths occurred in 2014 with 6 fatalities, correlating with the extraordinary outbreak that year. The following years until 2019 saw occasional deaths, never exceeding two per month. Notably, from February 2020 onwards, only one death was reported through September 2023, indicating either effective clinical management, reporting discrepancies, or a change in virus virulence. The sharp decline in deaths despite some resurgence in cases suggests improved healthcare responses or underreporting.

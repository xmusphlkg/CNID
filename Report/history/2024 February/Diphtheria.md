## Introduction

Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It primarily affects the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, producing a thick, gray coating in the nose, throat, or airway, which can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, or even death. Diphtheria is highly contagious and is spread through respiratory droplets or close contact. Thanks to widespread vaccination, diphtheria is now rare in many parts of the world. However, it can still occur, especially in areas where immunization rates are low. Vaccination remains the most effective means of prevention.

## Highlights

- Over the past decade, Diphtheria has been exceptionally rare in mainland China, reflecting a highly effective national vaccination program.<br/>
- The data suggests a sporadic occurrence rate, with only 5 reported cases between 2014 and 2024. The cases occurred in 2016, 2018, twice in 2020, and in 2021.<br/>
- There were no recorded Diphtheria-induced deaths in China from 2014 right through to February 2024.<br/>
- What is notable is a repeated pattern; minimal cases of infection were observed consistently around July and August over the years 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2023. More data and investigations are needed to determine if this pattern holds significance.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The displayed data for Diphtheria in the Chinese mainland depicts a consistently low prevalence of the disease from 2014 to 2024. A total of six individual cases were identified during this decade-long period, with one case reported in 2016, another in 2018, two in 2020, one in 2021, and the most recent in 2023. The sporadic nature of these occurrences suggests the absence of widespread transmission or outbreaks, indicative of effective disease prevention measures such as immunization and public health surveillance. Nevertheless, the persistent, albeit infrequent, appearance of cases underscores the necessity for ongoing vigilance.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality rate for Diphtheria in the Chinese mainland between 2014 and 2024 was consistently zero, as no deaths were reported throughout this ten-year timeline. Given the incidences of the disease over the same period, this suggests a robust health response and effective treatment of identified cases. This zero fatality rate could be attributable to factors such as timely diagnosis and intervention, access to adequate healthcare resources, and the use of efficient therapeutic protocols. Regardless, the data reveals a promising trend and encourages the continuation of current health strategies aimed at Diphtheria management.

## Introduction

Dysentery is an inflammatory disorder of the intestine, particularly of the colon, that results in severe diarrhea containing blood and mucus in the feces with frequent and painful bowel movements. It can be caused by various infectious pathogens such as bacteria (e.g., Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella), protozoan parasites (e.g., Entamoeba histolytica), or viruses. Transmission typically occurs through contaminated food or water, or through person-to-person contact. Comprehensive management includes rehydration, electrolyte replacement, and, in some cases, antibiotic or antiparasitic medications. Good hygiene practices are crucial in preventing the spread of dysentery.

## Highlights

1. The overall trend of Dysentery in mainland China from February 2014 to February 2024 shows a significant reduction in the number of cases. <br/>
2. Noticeable seasonal trend with the cases peaking between May to August each year, indicating potential environmental factors at play. <br/>
3. The mortality rate is very low, typically 0-3 deaths per month irrespective of the number of cases. <br/>
4. As of February 2024, the number of cases (1673) continues the decreasing trend, which indicates successful control and prevention measures.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Dysentery cases on Chinese mainland show a consistently annual, cyclical pattern, with the number of cases peaking in the summer (June to August) then sharply declining afterwards. The highest number of cases appears in 2014 with 22,311 cases in July, while the lowest number is reported in December 2022 with only 1,215 cases. Overall, the trend suggests a decrease across the years, with the annual peak progressively taking lower values, such as 19,689 in June 2015, 18,347 in August 2016, and 16,316 in July 2017, indicating an effective control of dysentery spread in the country.

### Deaths Analysis
Dysentery-related deaths in China are extremely low considering the number of reported cases. Between February 2014 and February 2024, there were only 22 recorded deaths resulting from Dysentery. The data also shows a random distribution of deaths throughout the years with no clear pattern or correlation with the number of cases. The highest mortality (3 deaths) was reported in July 2015 and January 2020, however, these spikes were not necessarily linked with the highest case numbers, suggesting an efficient management system in handling severe dysentery cases to prevent fatalities.

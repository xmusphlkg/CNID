## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a zoonotic infection caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. Humans become accidental hosts through ingestion of eggs found in the feces of infected definitive hosts, typically dogs and other canines. Larvae then develop into cysts in organs such as the liver and lungs. The two main types of the disease are cystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by Echinococcus granulosus and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by Echinococcus multilocularis. It is a global public health concern, especially in pastoral communities and areas where hygiene practices are inadequate.

## Highlights

- Echinococcosis cases in mainland China peaked significantly in March 2017 at 1,077 cases, exhibiting a fluctuating trend over the 10-year span. <br/>
- A notable reduction in case numbers began in 2020, with the monthly figures consistently lower thereafter compared to previous years. <br/>
- Fatalities remained exceptionally low despite case count variations, with only 6 deaths recorded between 2014-2024. <br/>
- Seasonal trends suggest higher cases in warmer months from March to July; however, this pattern has diminished in recent years. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024 February, the reported cases of Echinococcosis in Chinese mainland exhibit a general upward trend, with monthly cases ranging from 91 to 1077. Seasonal fluctuations are apparent, peaking in certain years like March 2017 at 1077 cases, while the lowest count of 91 was observed in February 2020, possibly influenced by a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant increase in the number of cases is noticeable starting from 2016. Despite fluctuations, there is no clear long-term seasonal pattern and no month consistently has the highest or lowest cases each year.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to Echinococcosis were rare between 2014 and 2024, with a total of six recorded deaths. The first death was reported in July 2015, with subsequent fatalities occurring irregularly in single units. No pattern in terms of seasonality or increase over time is discernible for the reported deaths. The relatively low mortality count suggests either a low fatality rate for the condition, potentially effective clinical management, or underreporting. Notably, February 2019 saw the highest mortality (2 deaths), an anomaly within the dataset.

## Introduction

Epidemic hemorrhagic fever is a group of viral diseases characterized by fever, bleeding disorders, and often kidney damage. These diseases can be caused by several distinct families of viruses like Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, and Flaviviridae. Notable examples include Ebola, Dengue, Yellow Fever, and Hantavirus. Transmission varies, encompassing vectors like mosquitoes and ticks or contact with infected animal excreta. Outbreaks can cause severe public health challenges, with certain forms having high fatality rates. Control measures hinge on vector control, improved sanitation, and in some cases, vaccine deployment.

## Highlights

- There's a seasonal pattern in the Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever cases and deaths in the Chinese mainland, with peaks occurring primarily in winter months, specifically between November and January of each year. <br/>
- From 2014 to 2024, there is a general trend towards the reduction in both cases and deaths, demonstrating the efficacy of control and prevention measures. <br/>
- The mortality rate remained low across the years, indicating effective clinical management for most cases. <br/>
- As of February 2024, there are 247 cases with no reported deaths, showing a good prognosis for current cases.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Data from the Chinese mainland shows an erratic yet persistent presence of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever from 2014 to 2024. In general, there are clear annual cycles, with cases often peaking between November and January, then declining to their lowest levels around August and September. This pattern occurs throughout most of the observed years. Despite some yearly fluctuations, the trend reveals a significant surge in cases towards winter months and indicates a pronounced winter seasonality for the transmission of the fever.

### Deaths Analysis
Although there has been a significant number of reported cases, the death rate remained relatively low throughout the decade. Deaths generally followed the pattern of cases, with more deaths occurring during peak months. However, there were instances where the death toll deviated significantly from the number of cases - September 2014, November 2018, and December 2021 are such examples. Overall, despite increases in reported cases during specific periods, advances in healthcare or improved reporting may be contributing to the relatively low and stable mortality rates.

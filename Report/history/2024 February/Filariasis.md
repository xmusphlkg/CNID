## Introduction

Filariasis is an infectious tropical disease caused by filarial worms, which are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. The worms primarily infect the lymphatic system, leading to lymphedema and sometimes elephantiasisâ€”extensive swelling of the limbs and genitals. The disease is categorized into two main types: Lymphatic Filariasis, caused by worms like Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori, and Onchocerciasis, or River Blindness, caused by Onchocerca volvulus. Chronic infection can lead to severe disability and social stigma, significantly impacting the quality of life and economic productivity in affected communities.

## Highlights

1. Filariasis remains a low-incidence disease in mainland China over the decade, with no report of fatalities. <br/>
2. Only two cases were reported during the entire period - one in November 2014 and the other in August 2021, suggesting a sporadic occurrence. <br/>
3. Since August 2021, there have been no new cases, indicating a downwards trend or possibly effective disease control measures.<br/>
4. As of February 2024, the situation remains stable with no new cases of Filariasis for the past 2.5 years.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the course of 10 years (2014-2024), the reported data reveals an exceptionally limited incidence rate of Filariasis on the Chinese mainland. Out of the 120 evaluated months, only two isolated cases were reported - one in November 2014 and the other in August 2021. Such minimal occurrence indicates that Filariasis is not a widespread public health issue in this geographical area.

### Deaths Analysis
Remarkably, throughout the same ten-year period, no deaths were reported due to Filariasis in mainland China, despite the two identified cases. The disease is primarily associated with chronic symptoms like lymphedema and elephantiasis rather than direct mortality, but its absence also suggests effective disease management and possibly successful treatment of the reported instances in the region.

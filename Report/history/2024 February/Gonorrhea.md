## Introduction

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It can affect both men and women, targeting moist and warm areas of the body including the urethra, throat, anus, and female reproductive tract. The infection is typically transmitted through sexual contact with an infected individual. Gonorrhea is characterized by symptoms such as painful urination, and abnormal genital discharge, though some infected individuals may remain asymptomatic. If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to serious health complications, including infertility. It is usually treatable with antibiotics, though antibiotic resistance is a growing concern.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for gonorrhea in Chinese mainland from February 2014 to February 2024 exhibits an upward trend in case numbers with periodic fluctuations. Starting at 6,238 cases, there are noticeable peaks and troughs likely correlating with seasonal or behavioral patterns. December often marks annual peaks, suggesting a potential increase in risk factors during this month. A significant drop appears in February 2020, which could be associated with the COVID-19 pandemic onset affecting reporting and transmission dynamics.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths from gonorrhea in Chinese mainland are extremely rare throughout the observed period, with only 14 deaths reported over ten years. The sporadic nature of these fatalities, with occasional occurrences in May 2014, December 2014, April 2016, December 2017, January and May 2018, November 2019, January 2020, May and July 2020, August and October 2021, January, April, and July 2022, and January 2024, suggests no clear temporal trend.

## Introduction

Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness that primarily affects infants and children. Caused by enteroviruses, such as Coxsackievirus A16 and Enterovirus 71, the disease is characterized by sores in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet. Transmission occurs through direct contact with an infected person's nose and throat secretions, saliva, fluid from blisters, or stool. HFMD is usually mild and self-limiting, with symptoms including fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, and feeling unwell, followed by blister-like lesions. There is no specific treatment, and prevention relies on good hygiene practices.

## Highlights

- There is a clear seasonal trend, with cases peaking from April to July each year. The highest peak previously seen was in May 2014 with 528,777 cases.<br/>
- From 2014 to 2020, there was an overall gradual decrease in both cases and deaths. The number of cases significantly dropped in 2020, likely due to measures implemented amid the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>
- However, a sharp increase in cases was observed in June and July 2023, reaching levels comparable to the highs of 2014.<br/>
- As of February 2024, the disease situation appears to be under control, with only 9,093 cases and no reported deaths.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) exhibited seasonality, with cases peaking often in May-June and showing a consequential drop towards winter each year. The data provided shows drastic oscillations in caseloads annually, peaking in 2016 at over 450,000 cases in June, followed by a noticeable decline to approximately 25,000 cases by 2024 February. A significant reduction in cases is visible from 2020 onward, which might correspond with the implementation of public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality associated with HFMD in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 followed a downward trajectory, showing high fatalities in the early years with a peak of 114 deaths in May 2014. The death counts decreased considerably by 2024, with no deaths reported from March 2023 onward. Initially, the fatality rate was higher during the peak months of transmission but later years demonstrate successful mitigation of severe outcomes, potentially attributed to improved medical care, public health interventions, and possible heightened immunity within the population.

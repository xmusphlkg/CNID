## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. It can be passed from mother to child during childbirth, through shared needles during drug use, and through unprotected sex. The infection can lead to serious conditions such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. While a vaccine to prevent hepatitis B has been available since the 1980s, the disease remains a major health problem, particularly in regions with poor access to healthcare.

## Highlights

- Increasing case trend: A steady increase in Hepatitis B cases from February 2014, peaking at 138,875 cases in August 2023. <br/>
- Deaths relatively stable: Fluctuations in monthly deaths observed, yet remaining below 50 deaths, indicating a possibly low fatality rate. <br/>
- Low fatality despite case surge: Despite the rise in cases, low death rates may suggest effective management and treatments. <br/>
- Recent surge in cases: A notable rise in cases as of early 2024 with 135,873 in January and 122,780 in February, signaling a potential public health challenge. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Since February 2014, Hepatitis B cases in the Chinese mainland have demonstrated a fluctuating pattern with a notable upward trend, peaking in December 2023 with 138,875 cases. Despite fluctuations, there is no clear seasonal predilection, with high case numbers scattered throughout different years and months. The data show a surge in reported cases starting from 2021, suggesting either an increase in transmission or improvements in surveillance and reporting systems. The sudden drop to 59,498 cases in December 2022 appears anomalous and may warrant investigation.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths attributed to Hepatitis B over the observed period show less variability, with the numbers generally ranging from 17 to 55 per month. An outlier is seen in January 2020, where 80 deaths were reported, coinciding with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly reflecting healthcare system strain. Despite the seeming increase in cases overall, death counts remained relatively stable, implying that case fatality rates may have decreased or that therapeutic interventions have effectively managed complications, preventing an upsurge in fatalities.

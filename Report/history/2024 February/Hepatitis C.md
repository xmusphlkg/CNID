## Introduction

Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). This bloodborne virus leads to hepatic inflammation and can vary in severity, varying from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong condition. Chronic hepatitis C can cause liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure. It is spread through contaminated blood, such as through needle sharing or transfusions with infected blood. While acute hepatitis C is often asymptomatic, chronic infection can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Treatments have advanced substantially, with direct-acting antivirals offering a high cure rate.

## Highlights

- Hepatitis C mortality in Chinese mainland has significantly increased since 2022, peaking in December 2023 at 393 deaths. <br/>
- Despite a reduction in reported cases from November 2022 to February 2024, the fatality ratio has risen. <br/>
- Peak cases occurred in March 2018 and 2023, suggesting potential seasonality in transmission. <br/>
- From February 2020, fewer cases were reported, possibly due to COVID-19 precautions; however, Hepatitis C deaths have since drastically increased.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hepatitis C cases in the Chinese mainland showed an upward trend from February 2014 to a peak in March 2023, with some fluctuations. Typically, cases increased in the early months of the year, then decreased towards the middle of the year, before a slight increase in later months. This trend repeated annually. The peak months of Hepatitis C cases occurred in March each year, where March 2023 recorded the highest cases. Comparably, lower cases numbers usually presented in the early and latter periods of the year. Starting from December 2022, there was a significant increment in the number of cases, indicating an aggressive spread.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to Hepatitis C from 2014 to 2019 was relatively low, with no more than 21 recorded in any month. However, there was a significant increase in death rates towards the end of 2022 which continued to surge through 2023. Between August and December 2023, death numbers advanced past three-digit figures, reaching the highest of 393 in December 2023. Remarkably, the death rates dropped to two-digits again in January 2024, with continuous decreases into February. Overall, the latter data suggests a concerning rise in Hepatitis C fatality rates over recent years.

## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as delta hepatitis, is a liver infection caused by the Hepatitis D virus (HDV) that only occurs in individuals who are simultaneously infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDV is transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, unprotected sex, and from infected mothers to their newborns. It is known to accelerate the progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in co-infected individuals. Although the global incidence of HDV infection has declined due to HBV vaccination, it remains a concern, particularly in regions with high HBV prevalence.

## Highlights

- Noticeable decline in Hepatitis D cases in mainland China observed from 2016-2024, with case counts dropping from 60 to 13 per month. <br/>
- Data trend suggests effective disease management practices are being employed. <br/>
- Zero mortality from Hepatitis D reported across the eight-year period, implying successful treatment strategies or low disease severity. <br/>
- As of February 2024, Hepatitis D is well-controlled in China with low case numbers and no reported deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2016 to February 2024, Chinese mainland reported a fluctuating trend in Hepatitis D cases with no observed fatalities. An initial fluctuation with cases ranging from 33 to 60 per month preceded a notable decline starting in 2020, with cases dropping to as low as 10 on two occasions. This downtrend persisted with sporadic increases; however, post-2020, the number of cases never exceeded 30 per month, demonstrating a considerable decrease compared to previous years. Overall, the trend suggests an improved control or reporting of the disease over the 8-year period.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the data span from 2016 to 2024, there were no reported deaths due to Hepatitis D in the Chinese mainland. This consistent zero fatality rate implies either an effective healthcare response to manage the disease, successful prevention measures, high treatment efficacy, or underreporting of fatal cases. With no mortalities over an 8-year period, the data presents an optimistic scenario for Hepatitis D outcomes in the region. However, without mortality data, it’s difficult to infer the true impact of Hepatitis D’s severity and fatality within the population.

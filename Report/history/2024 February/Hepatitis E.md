## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. The transmission is primarily fecal-oral, typically through contaminated water or food. It is most prevalent in areas with poor sanitation. While HEV infection often results in a self-limiting, acute illness, it can develop into fulminant hepatitis, particularly in pregnant women. Chronic infections may arise in immunocompromised individuals. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment for HEV, and prevention relies on maintaining adequate hygiene practices and ensuring safe drinking water.

## Highlights

- There's been a notable decrease in yearly case counts for Hepatitis E from a peak in 2014, reflecting effective intervention strategies. <br/>
- However, monthly data shows seasonal patterns, with most cases appearing in the first quarter of the year. <br/>
- Regarding the mortality rate, despite some isolated higher counts, it generally remained low indicating adequate healthcare measures. <br/>
- As of February 2024, case counts are on a rise after the usual dip following the peak in the first quarter. This indicates Hepatitis E remains a public health concern in China mainland. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hepatitis E cases in Chinese mainland display seasonality, with peaks typically in March and troughs in November from 2014 to 2024. The highest number of cases reported was in March 2016 at 3401 cases, indicating a potential outbreak or improved detection. Over the ten-year span, there's a general trend of increasing cases, particularly evident in the yearly first quarters. However, there was a notable decrease in cases beginning in 2020, potentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting exposure or reporting practices.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to Hepatitis E from 2014 to 2024 shows low fatality, with the majority of months reporting zero to three deaths. December 2017 reported the highest number of deaths at six. While there is no clear trend in fatalities over the years, the fatality rate fluctuates irregularly with no significant peak periods. The overall mortality appears minimal in relation to the number of cases, suggesting Hepatitis E maintains a low case-fatality rate throughout this period.

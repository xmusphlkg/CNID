## Introduction

Hepatitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the liver, often caused by viral infections. There are five main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D, and E. These viruses are the most common cause of human hepatitis, with diverse modes of transmission and impacts on health. Hepatitis can lead to acute or chronic disease, with potential outcomes ranging from mild illness to severe liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Immunization, improved sanitation, blood screening, and antiviral treatments help manage and prevent hepatitis infection and its consequences.

## Highlights

- A gradual increase in Hepatitis cases in mainland China, from 106,868 in February 2014 to 142,012 in February 2024, indicates an ongoing health concern.<br/>
- A stark rise in Hepatitis-related deaths from 2023, peaking at 428 in December, highlighting the emergence of a critical health crisis.<br/>
- An abrupt decline in cases to 72,630 in December 2022, with a subsequent rebound and rise throughout 2023 into 2024, suggests a variable disease pattern.<br/>
- From April 2023 onwards, deaths have escalated markedly, pointing to a need for urgent epidemiological interventions to address the worsening situation.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between February 2014 and February 2024, Hepatitis cases in Chinese mainland fluctuated, with apparent seasonal peaks often in March. Starting from 2014 with cases around 110,000, the numbers generally saw a rising trend, spiking significantly in 2023. The year 2024 began with an elevated count (159,136), suggesting a concerning increase in infections or improved case identification. March of each year consistently reported high case volumes, indicating possible seasonal factors influencing transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
The trend in Hepatitis-associated deaths from February 2014 to February 2024 shows variability, with deaths ranging between 25 and 428 per month. A notable rise in fatalities occurred from 2023 onwards, peaking at 428 in December 2023, followed by a decrease to 74 in February 2024. This sudden increase in mortality could be due to a more virulent strain, increased disease burden, or changes in reporting/healthcare access. The decrease in early 2024 could suggest effective intervention strategies or reporting changes.

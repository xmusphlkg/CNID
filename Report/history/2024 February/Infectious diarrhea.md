## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea is a condition characterized by frequent and loose bowel movements caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Commonly transmitted through contaminated food or water, it remains a significant health issue globally, especially in regions with poor sanitation. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and often include abdominal pain, fever, and dehydration. Prevention strategies include proper hygiene, safe food practices, water sanitation, and vaccinations for preventable diseases. Treatment largely depends on the etiology and may involve rehydration therapies, antibiotics, or antiparasitic medications for certain infections.

## Highlights

- Infectious diarrhea cases in Chinese mainland have been exhibiting a fluctuating trend with periodic peaks and troughs over the past decade. <br/>
- There is a consistent pattern of increase in the number of cases during the warmer months (May to August) each year, indicating a possible seasonality in disease transmission. <br/>
- The death toll has remained relatively low regardless of the cases' surge, underscoring effective management and treatment strategies.<br/>
- As of February 2024, the situation appears stable with no reported deaths and a case count of 125,289, consistent with the annual epidemic curve.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The incidence of infectious diarrhea in China from 2014 to 2024 shows seasonal trends, with peaks typically occurring during the summer months, reflecting potentially increased bacterial and viral growth rates and foodborne transmission. The highest recorded monthly cases (186,071) occurred in January 2018. An anomalous decrease is observed in February 2020, possibly attributable to public health interventions and behavioral changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, there's a noticeable downward trend in cases from December 2020, stabilizing to lower levels in 2023, indicating improved control measures or underreporting.

### Deaths Analysis
The fatality associated with infectious diarrhea from 2014 to 2024 remained extremely low despite fluctuating case numbers, with a total monthly death count never exceeding seven. The majority of months reported one or zero deaths, suggesting a relatively low mortality rate for infectious diarrhea or effective clinical interventions. A shift to zero deaths starting from July 2020 onwards is characteristic, possibly due to advancements in healthcare, increased immunity within the population, or changes in reporting. The data may also imply a successful public health response in managing severe cases.

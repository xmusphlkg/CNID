## Introduction

Influenza, or the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It affects the nose, throat, and occasionally the lungs. It spreads through airborne droplets from coughs or sneezes of infected individuals, leading to mild to severe disease. Severe cases can cause fatal complications. The disease intensity varies seasonally, with vaccines designed to mitigate its effects. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. Antiviral medications can treat severe cases or those at risk of complications.

## Highlights

- Major influenza outbreak observed in March 2023 with over 3.7 million cases, followed by 1.7 million in April 2023. <br/>
- High case numbers persisted in November and December 2023, indicating continuous disease transmission. <br/>
- By February 2024, substantial case decrease observed (1,179,029 cases), with zero influenza-associated deaths, hinting improved control measures. <br/>
- Clear seasonal influenza pattern: peaks during winter months, with record numbers in January 2019 and December 2023. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Influenza cases in the Chinese mainland over the 10-year period from 2014 to 2024 showed intermittent outbreaks with escalating peak numbers. Whilst the number fluctuated significantly month to month, an apparent trend is a surge of cases in winter months, presumably due to the ideal conditions for the virus to spread. The highest recorded monthly case count crossed the 4 million mark in December 2023, and the overall case trend is increasing over time despite some fluctuations.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the large number of influenza cases, the overall deaths remained relatively low. The highest death count was recorded in January 2019 with 143 deaths. Collectively, the death rate appeared to rise during seasons with higher reported influenza cases, specifically around winter months. However, the mortality rate remained relatively stable and did not exceed 0.02% in any given month. This suggests that while the transmissibility of the disease might be high, its fatality rate is considerably low in the context of the Chinese mainland.

## Introduction

Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is a parasitic disease caused by the Leishmania donovani complex transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. It primarily affects the visceral organs, especially the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Symptoms include fever, weight loss, anemia, and swelling of the liver and spleen. If left untreated, it can be fatal due to complications such as secondary infections. This disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, with cases reported in parts of Asia, East Africa, South America, and the Mediterranean basin. Control measures include vector management, early diagnosis, and treatment.

## Highlights

- Over the past decade (2014-2024), Kala azar cases in the Chinese mainland show no distinct pattern or significant trend, fluctuating throughout the years. Notably, each year shows a slight increase in cases from September to November.<br/>
- The disease's mortality rate is low, with six recorded deaths in comparison to its incidence.<br/>
- The highest case numbers were observed in 2015, particularly October and November. Since then, case numbers significantly decreased.<br/>
- Recent data (February 2024) shows a drop in cases (18) with no reported deaths, indicating the disease is currently under relative control.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between 2014 and 2024, the Chinese mainland reported a fluctuating pattern of Kala azar cases with periodic peaks, notably in November 2015 (123 cases), followed by a decline. The data suggests a cyclical trend with increases typically in the latter half of each year, although there are exceptions. The year 2023 witnessed heightened activity in the earlier months, particularly April with 34 cases. Overall, there were no prolonged, substantial surges, indicating sporadic outbreaks rather than a consistently spreading disease.

### Deaths Analysis
Kala azar had a low mortality rate on the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, with only five reported deaths over the ten-year period. Interestingly, each death occurred in different years (2014, 2016, 2020, 2022, 2023), depicting that while cases might fluctuate, fatalities remain sparse, implying either relatively effective treatment protocols or case management strategies minimizing deaths or that the strands circulating boasted lower lethality.

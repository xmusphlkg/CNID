## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes and is characterized by skin lesions and progressive neurological damage. Leprosy is curable with a course of multidrug therapy, is not highly infectious, and transmission likely involves close and frequent contacts with untreated cases. Despite being one of the oldest diseases known to humanity, leprosy remains a concern in some countries, necessitating continued public health efforts for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent disabilities and transmission.

## Highlights

- There has been a declining trend in the number of new leprosy cases reported monthly in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, indicating success of control measures. <br/>
- Despite the occasional spike, the average monthly case count drops from 70 in 2014 to 24 in 2024, suggesting effective progress in disease reduction. <br/>
- Leprosy-related deaths are extremely infrequent, with only three instances reported over the ten-year period (2016, 2019, 2021), suggesting that the disease is generally well-managed. <br/>
- As of February 2024, there were 24 newly reported cases, consistent with the reduced case rates observed in recent years, and no leprosy-related deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Leprosy cases in Chinese mainland displayed a general decrease from 2014, with periodic fluctuations peaking in March 2016 at 108 cases. Initial years (2014-2016) showed higher variability, while 2017 onwards demonstrated a leveling off, with fewer peaks and a dip to the lowest at 13 cases in October 2022. Seasonal trends are not distinctly apparent, although there are sporadic increases in March, possibly attributed to reporting practices or environmental factors. The data suggests a successfully contained situation with overall reduced case numbers over time.

### Deaths Analysis
The leprosy death toll in Chinese mainland over the reported period is notably low, with only two registered deaths despite several years of case reports. The first recorded death occurred in January 2016, followed by another isolated incident in December 2021. Given the prolonged periods without fatalities and consistent case reporting, this indicates effective clinical management and treatment of leprosy cases. The rare incidence of deaths underscores the relative success in mortality reduction related to leprosy in the region.

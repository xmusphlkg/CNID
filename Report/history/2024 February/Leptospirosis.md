## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete genus Leptospira. It is transmitted through the urine of infected animals, often in water or soil, and can penetrate the human body via skin abrasions or mucous membranes. Symptoms range from mild flu-like illness to severe manifestations, including Weil's disease, characterized by jaundice, kidney failure, and hemorrhagic manifestations. The infection is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, affecting those in close contact with animals or contaminated environments. Prevention involves controlling rodent populations, avoiding potentially contaminated water, and using protective clothing.

## Highlights

- Leptospirosis displays a seasonal pattern in China, with cases peaking in late summer and early autumn suggesting environmental influences on disease transmission. <br/>
- A significant spike of 207 cases in December 2014 hasn't been replicated since, indicating an outbreak that was subsequently controlled. <br/>
- Whilst deaths are generally low, surges in September 2014, October 2020, and September 2021 indicate potential severe case clusters. <br/>
- Latest data from 2024 indicates continued endemic presence, with low and stable case counts and no deaths, suggesting effective disease control.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Leptospirosis cases in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to early 2024 exhibit cyclical patterns, peaking typically in the months from July to November each year, indicating a possible seasonal influence. The highest number of cases (207) occurred in December 2014, a clear outlier compared to other periods. Overall, there was a notable surge in cases in 2020, particularly in September, which may warrant epidemiological investigation for potential outbreak causes. Despite some fluctuations, the incidence of cases generally showed a slight declining trend over the years.

### Deaths Analysis
Leptospirosis mortality followed an irregular pattern, with relatively few deaths reported annually. The total number of fatalities did not exceed four in any given month throughout the considered timeframe. Deaths are sporadically distributed with some temporal clusters, notably September 2020 and October of the same year, with three and four deaths, respectively. However, the overall case-fatality ratio appears low, suggesting either a mild disease presentation, effective clinical management, or a combination thereof within the Chinese mainland context.

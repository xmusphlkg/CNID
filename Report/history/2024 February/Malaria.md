## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. The most severe and prevalent form of malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, but other species such as P. vivax also contribute to the disease burden. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, and can lead to severe illness and death if untreated. Prevention and control measures include insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying, and antimalarial drugs. Despite ongoing efforts, malaria remains a major public health challenge, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.

## Highlights

- Malaria in China has been experiencing a downward trend from 2014 to 2022, with a significant decrease seen particularly in 2020. <br/>
- However, a gradual resurgence in cases is observed from late 2022 and throughout 2023, into early 2024. <br/>
- The average number of deaths has remained relatively low, averaging one to three a month, signifying high disease management. <br/>
- As of February 2024, there were 215 cases and 2 deaths, showing that despite recent increases, the situation is far improved from a decade earlier. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, Malaria cases in Chinese mainland show a marked decline, particularly after 2019, falling from the hundred to tens range. Initially, the monthly cases remained consistently above 200, peaking during the summer months, a pattern possibly linked to the vector's breeding season. The sharp drop in cases beginning in 2020 coincides with the global outbreak of COVID-19, suggesting pandemic-related factors such as reduced travel, increased public health measures, or reporting disparities may have impacted transmission or data collection.

### Deaths Analysis
Malaria-related deaths in the same period display a downward trend with no fatalities in several months post-2019. The reduced lethality could be attributed to improved healthcare, effective control measures, and awareness. The initial yearly fatalities were low but sporadic with occasional peaks (June 2014). The post-2020 decline in cases likely contributed to reduced death incidence. The few reported deaths even with lower case counts may indicate persistent focal areas of transmission or challenges in access to treatment for specific populations.

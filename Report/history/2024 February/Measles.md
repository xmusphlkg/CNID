## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever, cough, runny nose, inflamed eyes, and a distinctive red rash. It mainly affects children but can occur at any age. The measles virus is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Although it is preventable with vaccination, measles remains a leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths among young children globally, particularly in areas with low vaccination coverage. Measles outbreaks can occur in populations with decreased immunity or where vaccination rates have fallen.

## Highlights

- Measles cases in mainland China have significantly decreased from 4091 cases in February 2014 to only 31 cases in February 2024. <br/>
- The rate of reported measles-related deaths has also greatly improved over the decade, with no reported deaths since December 2016. <br/>
- Apart from a single peak in 2015 (8265 cases in April), the general trend indicates a steady decline in the number of cases over the years. <br/>
- Despite minor fluctuations in the monthly case count, recent years (since 2020) have consistently recorded less than 120 cases per month, signifying effective control measures.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From February 2014 to February 2024, Measles cases in the Chinese mainland showed a marked decrease. A peak of 11,089 cases occurred in April 2014, followed by a declining trend with periodic fluctuations. The most substantial drop-off happened post-2019, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting potential impacts from increased public health interventions like mask-wearing and social distancing. By 2024, reported cases had consistently remained below 120 per month, indicating effective control measures, although the necessity for continued vaccination and monitoring persists to prevent outbreaks.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality data reveals a low fatality rate from Measles in the Chinese mainland over the decade, with maximum recorded deaths at 7 in April 2015. Deaths dropped to zero post-August 2016 and remained so up to February 2024. This zero mortality could reflect improvements in healthcare, effective case management, heightened immunization efforts, and possibly reduced transmission due to overlapping public health measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, continuous surveillance is essential to maintain measles elimination status and promptly address any potential resurgence.

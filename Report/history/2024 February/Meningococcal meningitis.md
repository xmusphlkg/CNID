## Introduction

Meningococcal meningitis is an acute bacterial infection of the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Caused by Neisseria meningitidis, it can result in severe illness or death if not treated promptly. It is characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, increased sensitivity to light, and confusion. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets or close contact. Vaccines are available for prevention, and immediate antibiotic treatment is crucial for affected individuals. It primarily affects infants, young children, and adolescents.

## Highlights

1. There's a significant decrease in the number of both Meningococcal meningitis cases and deaths in Chinese mainland from 2014 through February 2024. The most reported cases were 33 in May 2014, whereas February 2024 saw only 11 cases.<br/>
2. The months of January and December recurrently peak in the number of cases, suggesting a seasonal trend. <br/>
3. The overall case fatality rate has considerably declined over the years, indicating possible advancements in early detection and treatment.<br/>
4. Despite fluctuations, there's a general downward trend in the incidence of Meningococcal meningitis over this decade, suggesting effective disease control measures.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from Chinese mainland displays a clear seasonal trend in meningococcal meningitis cases with peaks commonly occurring in the colder months, particularly January-April. There was a high of 33 cases in May 2014 and a low in August 2021 with no reported cases. Over the years, there is a noticeable downward trend in the number of cases, from 2014 to 2024, suggestive of effective interventions, increased herd immunity, or both.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality due to meningococcal meningitis in this region shows significant variability, with the highest recorded deaths being 6 in December 2017. Overall, the trend in deaths is less clear than that of case numbers, yet there's a general decrease over time with several months reporting zero fatalities, especially from 2020 onwards. This trend may indicate improved clinical management and possibly the implementation of more effective public health measures.

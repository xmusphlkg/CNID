## Introduction

Monkeypox is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus, which also includes the variola virus responsible for smallpox. The disease originates in wild animals like rodents and primates and can transmit to humans. Clinical presentations are similar to smallpox, featuring a fever, headache, muscle aches, and a distinctive bumpy rash. The infection typically resolves on its own, but support and treatment can ease symptoms. Monkeypox is primarily found in Central and West Africa, with occasional outbreaks in other regions. Vaccination against smallpox also offers some protection against monkeypox.

## Highlights

1. There's a steady presence of Monkeypox in the Chinese mainland with cases being reported every month since September 2023.<br/>
2. The peak occurred in October 2023 with 127 reported cases before subsequently declining.<br/>
3. Cases have decreased from January 2024 to February 2024, showing a potential decreasing trend.<br/>
4. Fortunately, there have been no recorded deaths despite the continued presence of the disease, indicating either low fatality rates or effective treatments.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicate a minor outbreak of Monkeypox in Chinese mainland with initial cases peaking in October 2023 at 127 cases. This was followed by a reduction in November, suggesting a possible effective initial response. December 2023 saw a minor resurgence to 102 cases, potentially due to a relaxation of control measures or increased social interactions. However, the numbers started to decline steadily in the following months of January and February 2024, with 97 and 70 cases respectively, indicating that the outbreak might be under control, assuming no significant underreporting.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported Monkeypox data for the Chinese mainland over the six-month period from September 2023 to February 2024 show zero fatalities. This could reflect either or a combination of the following: the efficacy of the healthcare response, the virulence strain in circulation being less lethal, or successful containment measures limiting spread to the most vulnerable populations. Itâ€™s imperative that further analysis is conducted to confirm these findings, considering the potential for underreporting or misclassification of Monkeypox-related deaths.

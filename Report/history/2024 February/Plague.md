## Introduction

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It primarily affects rodents but can spread to other animals and humans through fleas that have bitten infected animals. Human plague infections continue to occur in rural areas and are found primarily in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Plague is infamous for causing severe epidemics throughout history, including the Black Death that wiped out a significant portion of Europe's population in the 14th century. There are three main forms of human plague: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, each presenting with different symptoms and levels of severity.

## Highlights

- Plague in the Chinese mainland displays sporadic occurrences from 2014 to 2023 with a total of 18 reported cases and 9 deaths. <br/>
- The cases are distributed irregularly with occasional spikes such as November 2019 (4 cases, 0 deaths) and August 2023 (4 cases, 1 death), suggesting episodic outbreaks. <br/>
- The fatality ratio seems relatively high when cases are reported; however, large periods with no cases are observed, indicating a possible effective surveillance and rapid containment system. <br/>
- As of February 2024, no new cases or deaths have been reported, suggesting currently stable control of the disease within the mainland. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, a sporadic occurrence of Plague cases was reported in various months across different years in the Chinese mainland, with a total of 16 cases. A peak incidence was observed in November 2019, with 4 reported cases. The cases primarily occurred in the summer and autumn months, suggesting possible seasonal patterns in Plague transmission. Despite the sporadic nature, there's no steady increase or decrease trend, signifying the disease wasn't entirely eradicated within this timespan, and so continued public health vigilance is essential. 

### Deaths Analysis
Out of the 16 reported cases over 10 years, nine deaths were recorded, indicating a high case-fatality ratio (>50%). Highest deaths (2) were observed in October 2014 and August 2020, concurrently with case occurrence. Interestingly, a death was reported in January 2020, despite no reported case in the same month. This could suggest late reporting or a prolonged disease course from a case in the previous month. The significant fatality rate underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment to reduce plague-associated mortality.

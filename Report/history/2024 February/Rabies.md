## Introduction

Rabies is a viral disease that primarily affects mammals, transmitted through the saliva of infected animals via bites or scratches. It is caused by the rabies virus, a member of the Lyssavirus genus. The virus attacks the central nervous system, leading to brain inflammation and, if untreated before symptoms appear, it is almost invariably fatal. Symptoms include fever, tingling at the site of exposure, progressing to violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Vaccination after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) is highly effective in preventing the disease.

## Highlights

- Overall trend of the number of Rabies cases and deaths in mainland China from 2014 to 2024 shows a consistent decrease. <br/>
- Despite seasonal fluctuations, there's a clear downward trend in both cases and deaths, contribution possibly due to better vaccination and awareness methods. <br/>
- In February 2024, there were 4 recorded cases and 2 deaths from Rabies, representing a significant decrease compared to numbers from 10 years prior. <br/>
- Yearly analysis also suggests that despite the reduction, the disease remains persistent in the region, indicating ongoing transmission and a need for continuous surveillance. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From February 2014 to February 2024, reported rabies cases in mainland China have shown a decreasing trend. There was an initial surge in 2014 reaching a peak in September (105 cases), after which a fluctuating decline is observed. Since 2016, the number of cases consistently diminished year-on-year, indicating potential improvements in preventive measures, such as increased vaccination of domestic animals and post-exposure prophylaxis in humans. The marked reduction in cases post-2019 may also reflect changes in surveillance or reporting, potentially influenced by broader public health developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to rabies in the same period also demonstrate an overall decreasing pattern but with less pronounced seasonality than cases. The highest mortality was observed in 2014 and 2015, with July 2014 having the highest recorded fatalities (84 deaths). The fatality numbers closely mirror the case counts, suggesting a consistent case-fatality rate across the years. 2019 onwards shows a significant drop in deaths, which may correlate with the reduced number of reported cases, improved access to medical care, or enhanced effectiveness of clinical management of rabies exposure. The spike in deaths in December 2020 and 2021 requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

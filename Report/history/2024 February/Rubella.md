## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German measles, is a contagious viral infection with a notable red rash. It is mild for most but poses severe risks to pregnant women, potentially causing congenital defects in the fetus. Transmitted through respiratory droplets, its prevention is effectively managed through the MMR vaccine. Global health efforts prioritize combating rubella due to its potential impact on pregnancy.

## Highlights

- There is a noticeable decline in rubella cases on the Chinese mainland from 2014, with numbers peaking again drastically in 2019 but falling once more from 2020 onwards. <br/>
- Monthly cases in recent years (2022-2024) have been maintaining at relatively low levels, generally under 200 cases per month. <br/>
- Despite the fluctuation in cases, the fatality rate remains extremely low with only 3 deaths reported over the entire period. <br/>
- As of February 2024, the situation appears controlled, with only 33 cases and no deaths reported for that month.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reflect a significant fluctuation in reported rubella cases in the Chinese mainland, with a noticeable peak in 2019, particularly in April (7471 cases) and May (9095 cases). Following this peak, there was a marked decline, with cases remaining relatively low (<300 cases/month) since March 2020. The data likely reflect the impact of enhanced vaccination efforts and possibly public health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the overall downward trend, minor increases were observed sporadically, such as in March 2022 (98 cases), indicating potential sporadic outbreaks or reporting inconsistencies.

### Deaths Analysis
Rubella is generally a mild disease, and this is supported by the mortality data, which show only two reported deaths within the studied timeframe, despite multiple thousands of cases. Both deaths occurred in the month of March, one in 2015 and another in 2022, suggesting no clear temporal mortality pattern. The near-zero mortality rate observed may indicate effective case management and a low rate of complications, such as Congenital Rubella Syndrome, which can result from maternal infection during pregnancy. It also underscores the relatively low lethality of the rubella virus among the general population.

## Introduction

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a pathogen that caused a global outbreak in 2002-2003. Belonging to the Coronaviridae family, it is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. SARS-CoV primarily spreads through respiratory droplets, leading to severe respiratory illness characterized by fever, cough, and in some cases, life-threatening pneumonia. The outbreak originated in Guangdong, China, and swiftly spread to other regions, infecting over 8,000 individuals and causing around 800 deaths. The containment of SARS-CoV was achieved through quarantine measures, travel restrictions, and heightened surveillance, which successfully interrupted human-to-human transmission.

## Highlights

- There have been no reported cases or deaths from SARS-CoV in mainland China from February 2014 to February 2024. <br/>
- This ten-year trend suggests effective public health measures and/or natural containment of the virus. <br/>
- As of the latest data of February 2024, the SARS-CoV situation in China remains stable and unthreatening. <br/>
- Continuous monitoring is recommended to maintain this status and for early detection in the unlikely event of a new outbreak. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reveals a remarkable consistency in reported cases of SARS-CoV in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, with no cases reported throughout this 10-year span. This reflects successful containment and absence of any SARS-CoV outbreaks within these regions during this period. Contemporary preventive measures, robust public health infrastructure, and efficient tracking systems appear to be greatly efficient in moderating the potential spread of SARS-CoV.

### Deaths Analysis
The death count for SARS-CoV in the Chinese mainland remains stagnant at zero over a decade-long period (2014-2024), parallel to the case count. This indicates no occurrence of fatal SARS-CoV infections during this time frame. The zero mortality rate can be attributed to the absence of disease spread and effective medical response systems ensuring prompt and efficient clinical management of any potential infections.

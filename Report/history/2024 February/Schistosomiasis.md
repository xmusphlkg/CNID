## Introduction

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. The urinary or intestinal systems of humans can be affected. People become infected when they come into contact with freshwater that contains the larvae of the parasite, released by freshwater snails. The disease is found in tropical and subtropical regions, primarily in Africa, Asia, and South America. Chronic infection can lead to organ damage, and it's a significant cause of morbidity, affecting millions worldwide. Prevention focuses on reducing exposure to contaminated water and mass deworming with praziquantel.

## Highlights

- Schistosomiasis cases in Chinese mainland have been generally decreasing over the past decade, with a steep drop observed from 2015 to 2017. <br/>
- There is also a consistent seasonal trend, with cases often peaking in the second half of each year (Aprilâ€“October) and remaining lower during the rest of the year. <br/>
- Mortality is extremely low, with only one death reported over the entire period, which occurred in February 2020. <br/>
- By February 2024, schistosomiasis cases remain relatively low, indicating successful control measures over the years.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Schistosomiasis on the Chinese mainland showed significant fluctuations over the decade. An alarming spike was observed in 2015, with cases rising dramatically to a peak of 10,481 in November. The surge subsided substantially by 2016, with numbers returning to hundreds rather than thousands. After a smaller peak in October 2017, the incidence has markedly declined, reaching single or low double digits by 2019 and remaining low into 2024. This drastic reduction indicates effective control measures, although regular small-scale resurgences suggest ongoing transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Schistosomiasis-associated mortality remained consistently at zero from February 2014 until the singular death recorded in February 2020. This suggests a low fatality rate or effective management of severe cases in this period. The absence of further deaths post-2020 indicates continued successful medical intervention and possibly improved healthcare accessibility or public health campaigns leading to early detection and treatment. Despite occasional case spikes, the control of fatal outcomes appears to have been effectively sustained throughout the years.

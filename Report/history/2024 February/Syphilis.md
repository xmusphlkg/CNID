## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Characterized by distinct stages, including primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary, it is spread through direct contact with a syphilitic sore during sexual activity or from mother to child during pregnancy. Initial symptoms may include a painless ulcer at the site of infection. If untreated, the disease can progress, leading to serious systemic effects and even death. Diagnosis is typically through blood tests, and treatment usually involves antibiotics like penicillin. Prevention includes safe sex practices and regular testing.

## Highlights

1. Syphilis cases in Chinese mainland generally increase over time, peaking in the summer months, with the highest occurring in August 2023 (61068 cases).<br/>
2. Despite case fluctuations, related deaths remain relatively low, implying effective disease management or treatment.<br/>
3. As of 2024 February, the trajectory suggests an ongoing increase in cases but not proportional deaths.<br/>
4. With 46868 cases and 3 deaths in February 2024, prevention of transmission remains a substantial challenge. 


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, the reported cases of syphilis in Chinese Mainland show an uptrend with some seasonal fluctuations. An initial steady increase is visible until mid-2017, with cases often exceeding 40,000 per month. Post-2017, cases see a pronounced rise, peaking in August of 2023 at 61,068. Notable dips occur annually around February, possibly due to the Chinese New Year effect, where decreased clinic visits may occur. The increase in cases over time may reflect enhanced surveillance, greater public awareness, or actual increases in syphilis transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Reported deaths due to syphilis fluctuated minimally between 2014 and 2024, with monthly deaths commonly in the single digits. A spike in January 2020 with 25 deaths is a clear outlier. Overall, deaths remained rare against the backdrop of increasing cases, suggesting improved treatment outcomes or underreporting of syphilis-associated mortality. The consistently low death rate throughout the decade indicates that while syphilis infections are prevalent, they are seldom directly fatal, possibly due to advances in detection and treatment protocols.

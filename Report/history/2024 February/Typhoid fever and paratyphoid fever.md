## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are caused by the bacteria Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, respectively. These systemic infections are characterized by fever, headache, constipation or diarrhea, rose-colored spots on the chest, and an enlarged spleen and liver. Transmission occurs primarily through ingestion of contaminated food or water. These diseases are endemic in regions with inadequate sanitation. Typhoid fever can lead to severe complications and death if not treated promptly, typically with antibiotics. Preventative measures include vaccination and ensuring safe drinking water and food practices.

## Highlights

- Steady decline in typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases from 2014 to 2024, with higher incidences typically in summer months (June-August). <br/>
- Low mortality rate, with deaths sporadically occurring over the decade. <br/>
- Lowest case count recorded in February 2024 with 190 cases and no deaths, indicative of continued decline. <br/>
- Possible seasonal pattern with case spikes in warmer months, suggesting a relationship with temperature or behavioral changes. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The trend for Typhoid and Paratyphoid fevers in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to early 2024 shows seasonality with peaks during the summer months (May to July) and declines in winter (December to February). Cases gradually increased from February to July almost every year before declining towards winter. Reported cases significantly dropped starting in 2020, possibly due to public health measures for COVID-19. Notably, 2023 reflects a similar pattern but with lower numbers compared to previous years, indicating a potential long-term decline in incidences or improved preventive measures.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality data reveals a very low death count associated with Typhoid and Paratyphoid fevers, with only 12 deaths reported over the near-decade span. Isolated fatalities occurred sporadically without a clear temporal pattern. The highest number of deaths in a single month was 3, observed in June 2017. The low fatality rates suggest effective clinical management and treatment of diagnosed cases. However, the presence of deaths underscores the need for continuous surveillance, vaccination, and water sanitation measures to control and prevent outbreaks.

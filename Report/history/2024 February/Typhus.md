## Introduction

Typhus is a group of infectious diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria, transmitted by lice, fleas, mites, or chiggers. The most common forms are epidemic typhus, spread by body lice and carrying a high mortality rate if untreated, and endemic (murine) typhus, transmitted by fleas from rodents. Symptoms often include fever, headache, rash, and muscle pain. Typhus can be severe but is treatable with antibiotics. Preventative measures focus on sanitation, reducing contact with vectors, and treating infestations. Vaccines are not widely available, making vector control crucial in managing typhus outbreaks.

## Highlights

- Typhus cases in China show a seasonal trend, increasing from spring (April/May) and peaking towards late summer and early autumn (August to October) each year. <br/>
- The annual peak cases fluctuated over the years, with the highest registered in September 2023 with 227 cases. <br/>
- Total number of reported deaths due to Typhus has been extremely low, with only three recorded fatalities over a span of ten years from 2014 to 2024. <br/>
- The most recent data from February 2024 suggests a low Typhus case rate, consistent with cyclical patterns observed in previous years.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Typhus in the Chinese mainland exhibit seasonality, with higher incidence typically observed in the warmer months (May through October). Starting with 70 cases in February 2014, numbers steadily increased and peaked at 257 cases in October of the same year. A similar pattern recurs each year, suggesting environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, might influence the vector population or human behavior. There is an overall increasing trend over the years, culminating in 227 cases in September 2023, indicating a possible expansion of typhus-endemic areas or improved surveillance and reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
Typhus in the Chinese mainland appears to have a low mortality rate, with only three reported deaths over the examined periodâ€”one each in June 2014, August 2015, and September 2016. The sporadic nature of deaths, in contrast to the number of cases, suggests that Typhus, while capable of causing severe illness, has been largely non-fatal, possibly due to effective clinical management. This trend also indicates that the pathogenicity of the circulating strains might be relatively low, or that access to healthcare is sufficient to prevent most fatalities.

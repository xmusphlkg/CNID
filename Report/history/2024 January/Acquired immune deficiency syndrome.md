## Introduction

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging the immune system, HIV interferes with the body's ability to fight the organisms that cause disease. AIDS is the most severe phase of HIV infection. People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems, which leaves them vulnerable to a range of opportunistic infections or cancers. Without treatment, the life expectancy with AIDS is about three years. Initially, symptoms are flu-like, but they progressively worsen without intervention.

## Highlights

- Steady increase in AIDS cases and deaths in China from 2014 to 2018, peaking in December 2018 with 7897 cases and 2444 deaths. <br/>
- Surge in 2019 and 2020, with highest deaths in December 2020 (2105). Brief decline during early COVID-19 pandemic. <br/>
- From 2021, fluctuating case numbers with a general upward trend in deaths, peaking in December 2021 (7490 cases, 2486 deaths). Slight decrease in 2022 and 2023. <br/>
- January 2024 shows a decrease in cases (3194) but deaths remain high (1730), highlighting ongoing mortality challenges.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, the data for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the Chinese mainland shows a fluctuating yet generally increasing trend in both cases and deaths. Initially, the numbers were relatively lower, with cases starting at 2245 in January 2014 and deaths at 739. Over the years, a noticeable increase occurs, peaking in 2018 with 7897 cases and 2467 deaths in December. Post-2018, while fluctuations continue, the trend remains upwards, indicating persistent transmission and challenges in curbing the disease despite efforts. The data underscores the ongoing public health challenge AIDS poses in China.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from AIDS in the Chinese mainland, as indicated by the data, mirrors the case trend with an overall ascending trajectory from 2014 to 2024. The initial figures in January 2014 stood at 739 deaths, which gradually increased, reaching a peak in December 2018 with 2467 deaths. This peak reflects the highest mortality within the observed period, after which a pattern of fluctuation is evident, albeit with a generally high number of deaths. The persistence of high mortality rates despite advancements in treatment and prevention strategies highlights significant hurdles in disease management and the critical need for enhanced public health interventions.

## Introduction

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious, viral eye infection characterized by sudden onset of painful, red eyes, often with bleeding under the conjunctiva and severe eyelid swelling. It's typically caused by enteroviruses, specifically Coxsackie A24 and Enterovirus 70. Outbreaks are common in tropical and subtropical regions, and the infection spreads rapidly in crowded conditions. While AHC usually resolves within 1-2 weeks without long-term effects, supportive treatments like cold compresses and artificial tears can alleviate symptoms. Rarely, neurological complications such as acute flaccid paralysis may occur.

## Highlights

- Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) cases in the Chinese mainland have shown significant fluctuations over the years, with a dramatic peak in September 2023 (125,264 cases). <br/>
- The trend reveals a generally increasing pattern in the number of cases, especially noticeable from mid-2023, indicating a possible outbreak or increased transmission during this period. <br/>
- Despite the high number of cases, the disease has maintained a low mortality rate, with only 3 deaths recorded since the data collection began, all occurring between 2019 and 2020. <br/>
- As of January 2024, there has been a decrease in cases to 3,039, suggesting a potential reduction in transmission or effective control measures being implemented. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) in the Chinese mainland saw fluctuating cases from 2014 to 2023, with a notable peak in September 2023 (125,264 cases). The data shows a general trend of annual fluctuations with seasonal peaks, typically in the warmer months. However, the unprecedented spike in 2023 suggests an outbreak or increased reporting. Prior to 2023, the highest reported cases were in July 2019 (5,265 cases), indicating a relatively stable pattern of incidence over the years. The absence of deaths until February 2020, where 2 deaths were recorded, highlights the typically non-lethal nature of AHC.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths associated with AHC in the Chinese mainland were extremely rare, with the first death recorded in August 2019 and two more in February 2020. Despite the significant increase in case numbers, particularly in 2023, there were no subsequent deaths reported. This suggests that while AHC can spread rapidly, resulting in large outbreaks as seen in 2023, the condition remains non-fatal in most instances. The low mortality rate might reflect effective public health responses, the self-limiting nature of the disease, or both. The data underscores the importance of surveillance and prompt response to control outbreaks while highlighting the non-lethal risk profile of AHC.

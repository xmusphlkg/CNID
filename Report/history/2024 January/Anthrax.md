## Introduction

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It primarily affects livestock and wild animals, but humans can become infected through direct or indirect contact with sick animals. Human infection can occur via three routes: cutaneous (skin), inhalation, and gastrointestinal. Symptoms vary by infection route but can include skin lesions, respiratory distress, and severe gastrointestinal issues. Anthrax is not contagious from person to person. Effective vaccines and antibiotics exist for prevention and treatment. Control measures focus on vaccinating livestock and handling potentially infected animal products with care.

## Highlights

- **Seasonal Peaks**: Anthrax cases in China show clear seasonal trends, peaking in July and August, suggesting links to climate or agricultural practices. <br/>
- **Rising Trend Over Time**: A general increase in cases over the years, with significant spikes observed in 2016, 2018, and 2021, highlights the need for better surveillance and prevention. <br/>
- **Low Mortality Rates**: Despite case fluctuations, anthrax mortality rates remain low, with deaths sporadic and not exceeding two per peak season. <br/>
- **Recent Decline**: As of January 2024, there's a noticeable decline in cases to just 7, indicating potential improvements in control or reporting.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Anthrax cases in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 show fluctuating trends, with a noticeable increase during summer months, particularly in July and August, suggesting a seasonal pattern possibly linked to agricultural cycles and livestock interaction. The years 2016, 2018, and 2021 notably peak, indicating sporadic outbreaks. The overall data reflect endemic presence with variable intensity, highlighting the need for continuous surveillance, preventive vaccination of livestock, and public health education to mitigate risks.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from Anthrax, while relatively low, indicates lethal potential, primarily occurring in peak transmission months like July, August, and December, aligning with increased case counts. The fatalities recorded are sporadic but persistent over the years, underscoring the disease's ongoing risk to public health. This pattern necessitates enhanced diagnostic facilities, prompt treatment protocols, and robust reporting mechanisms to prevent mortality and control the spread of this zoonotic disease within susceptible populations.

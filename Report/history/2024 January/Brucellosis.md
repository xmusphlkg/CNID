## Introduction

Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by bacteria of the genus *Brucella*. It primarily affects livestock (such as cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs) but can also infect humans. Transmission to humans occurs through direct contact with infected animals or by consuming contaminated animal products. Symptoms in humans include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, and muscle pain. Brucellosis is known for its persistent, flu-like symptoms and can lead to more severe complications if not treated properly. Preventive measures include vaccination of animals, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding unpasteurized dairy products.

## Highlights

- A significant increase in Brucellosis cases from 2014 to 2023, with peaks during the summer months, indicating a seasonal trend. <br/>
- The highest number of cases recorded in June 2021 with 9670 cases, showing a substantial year-over-year growth in incidence rates. <br/>
- A notable decrease in cases to 4207 in January 2024, suggesting a potential improvement in disease control or reporting. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations in case numbers, the death toll remained extremely low, indicating effective clinical management and possibly underreporting of fatalities. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Brucellosis cases in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 shows a generally increasing trend in the number of reported cases, especially notable from 2021 onwards. Seasonal patterns are evident, with peaks typically in the summer months (June, July, and August) and troughs in winter (December, January, and February). This seasonal variation could be related to agricultural practices and the increased interaction between humans and animals, which are primary vectors for Brucellosis transmission. The highest number of cases reported in a single month was in June 2022, with 9943 cases, indicating a significant public health concern.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths from Brucellosis over the same period are remarkably low, considering the high number of cases, which suggests a low fatality rate for the disease in Chinese mainland. Deaths are sporadic and do not show a clear seasonal pattern, which could indicate effective management and treatment of cases once identified. The total number of deaths reported each year remained at or below two, with some years recording no deaths at all. This low mortality rate might reflect improvements in healthcare response and the effectiveness of public health interventions aimed at controlling the spread of the disease.

## Introduction

Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*. It primarily affects the small intestine and is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated water or food. Symptoms include severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, which can lead to death if untreated. Cholera outbreaks are closely linked to inadequate access to clean water and sanitation facilities, affecting populations in areas with poor water infrastructure. Preventive measures include safe water practices, proper sanitation, and oral cholera vaccines. Treatment involves rehydration, oral rehydration salts, and antibiotics in severe cases.

## Highlights

- Seasonal peaks in cholera cases during summer months (July, August, September) suggest climate or activity-driven transmission in China mainland.<br/>
- Despite annual case fluctuations, zero fatalities indicate effective treatment and healthcare access.<br/>
- August 2018 and 2019 saw the highest monthly cases (12), highlighting periods of increased transmission risk.<br/>
- No cases or deaths reported in January 2024, pointing to effective control or potential underreporting.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Cholera in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 shows sporadic outbreaks with a clear seasonal pattern, peaking in the warmer months (June to September). Notably, the numbers remained relatively low, with the highest recorded cases being 12 in August 2018 and September 2019. This suggests effective public health measures and possibly improved water sanitation practices. The zero cases reported from January 2024 indicate either successful eradication efforts or a delay in data reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
Remarkably, despite the fluctuating number of Cholera cases reported from 2014 to 2024, there were no reported deaths. This indicates highly effective clinical management and public health interventions in place across Chinese mainland. The consistent zero death toll underscores the importance of rapid treatment and possibly reflects advancements in healthcare infrastructure and public awareness about the disease.

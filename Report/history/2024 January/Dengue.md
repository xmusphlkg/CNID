## Introduction

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection causing a severe flu-like illness that can potentially develop into a fatal complication called severe dengue. The dengue virus has four distinct serotypes; infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity to it but not to the others. Transmission occurs through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti, found worldwide in urban and suburban areas. There is no specific treatment for dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care significantly lowers fatality rates. Prevention focuses on mosquito control and avoiding bites.

## Highlights

- **Seasonal peaks**: Dengue cases in China peak from July to October, correlating with warmer, humid conditions favorable for mosquito breeding. <br/>
- **Yearly fluctuations**: Significant annual variation in cases, with major outbreaks in 2014, 2019, and 2023, highlights the episodic nature of dengue and the impact of health interventions. <br/>
- **Post-2019 decrease**: A notable decline in cases after 2019 suggests effective vector control and public health measures. <br/>
- **Low mortality rate**: Despite case fluctuations, the mortality rate remains low, indicating successful case management and treatment in China.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Dengue cases in Chinese mainland show significant seasonality and inter-annual variability, with peaks typically in late summer and early autumn. The data reveals outbreaks with a notable increase in cases, such as in September 2014, October 2014, and more recently, between July and September 2023. These outbreaks suggest periods of heightened transmission, possibly due to environmental conditions favorable to the mosquito vector. The sharp decline in cases post-2019, especially noticeable in 2021 and 2022, could indicate effective vector control measures or underreporting. However, a resurgence in 2023 underscores the ongoing challenge of dengue control.

### Deaths Analysis
Dengue-related deaths are rare, indicating either the less severe nature of the strains circulating in Chinese mainland or effective clinical management of cases. The data shows sporadic occurrences of fatalities, with a total of 10 deaths recorded between 2014 and 2023, despite the fluctuating case numbers. The highest mortality (4 deaths) was reported in September 2014 during a significant outbreak. Deaths in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2023 were isolated incidents, highlighting that while dengue poses a public health concern in terms of case numbers, the risk of death remains low, likely due to improved healthcare response and disease awareness.

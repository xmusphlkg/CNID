## Introduction

Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection caused by *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*. It spreads through respiratory droplets and can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat, leading to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, and even death. Symptoms include sore throat, fever, and swollen glands. The disease is preventable through vaccination, with the DTaP vaccine being highly effective. Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotics. It's more common in areas with poor sanitation or where vaccination rates are low.

## Highlights

- Diphtheria cases in Chinese mainland from 2014 to January 2024 have been extremely rare, indicating effective disease control and prevention strategies. <br/>
- Occasional cases appeared in 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2022, with a single case reported in June of each of these years, but with no resulting deaths. This suggests an effective response system to isolated outbreaks. <br/>
- The consistent reporting of zero deaths throughout the period highlights the effectiveness of the healthcare system in managing the few cases that do occur. <br/>
- As of January 2024, there are no reported cases or deaths from Diphtheria, maintaining the trend of effective control and prevention of the disease.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Diphtheria in Chinese mainland from 2014 to the beginning of 2024 shows an extremely low incidence rate, with only six cases reported and no deaths. These isolated cases occurred in October 2016, June 2018, August and September 2020, July 2021, and June 2023, indicating sporadic outbreaks rather than sustained transmission. The absence of deaths highlights the effectiveness of public health interventions, including vaccination and rapid response to cases, in preventing fatalities and controlling the spread of this bacterial infection.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported data for Diphtheria in Chinese mainland over a decade shows zero deaths, underscoring the high efficacy of public health measures in place. Despite the occurrence of six cases during this period, the lack of fatalities can be attributed to effective vaccination programs, early detection, and prompt medical treatment. This success demonstrates the importance of maintaining high immunization coverage and robust health surveillance systems to prevent diphtheria fatalities and manage potential outbreaks effectively.

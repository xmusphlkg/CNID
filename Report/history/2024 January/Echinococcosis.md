## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the genus *Echinococcus*. Humans become infected through ingestion of parasite eggs in contaminated food, water, or soil, or through direct contact with animal hosts. The disease is characterized by the slow growth of cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs, which can cause serious health problems or be fatal if not treated. It is most prevalent in regions where livestock is raised in close contact with dogs, the primary carriers. Diagnosis and treatment involve imaging techniques and, in many cases, surgery and antiparasitic medications.

## Highlights

- A notable increase in Echinococcosis cases from 2014 to a peak in 2017, followed by fluctuations with a significant decrease observed from 2022 onwards. <br/>
- Deaths are extremely rare, with a total of only 7 reported deaths over the entire period, indicating potentially effective treatment or management of cases. <br/>
- The sharp decrease in cases in 2020 could be related to global health measures affecting reporting and transmission dynamics. However, cases have begun to rise again by January 2024. <br/>
- The data suggests a need for continued surveillance, public health interventions, and research to understand the drivers of Echinococcosis transmission in the Chinese mainland.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reveals a fluctuating trend in Echinococcosis cases across the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, with an initial steady increase in cases peaking in 2016 and 2017. Notably, a sharp decline is observed from 2022, indicating potential improvements in public health interventions or reporting mechanisms. The highest recorded cases occurred in March 2017, with 1077 cases, while the lowest was in November 2022, with 97 cases. Seasonal variations are evident, with peaks generally in the warmer months, suggesting possible links to transmission vectors or human activities.

### Deaths Analysis
Death occurrences due to Echinococcosis were exceptionally rare throughout the observed period, with a total of 7 reported deaths despite the fluctuating case numbers. The first death was recorded in July 2015, indicating a period of case accumulation before resulting in fatalities. The distribution of deaths does not follow a clear pattern or correlation with the case peaks, highlighting the potential effectiveness of treatment or intervention strategies. However, the presence of deaths underscores the disease's potential severity and the importance of continued surveillance and healthcare access.

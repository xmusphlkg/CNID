## Introduction

Epidemic hemorrhagic fever refers to a group of viral infections characterized by fever, bleeding disorders, and vascular damage, leading to shock and potential multi-organ failure. These diseases, including Ebola, Dengue, and Hantavirus, are often zoonotic, transmitted from animals to humans. Outbreaks can result from contact with infected animal hosts or vectors, such as mosquitoes and rodents, and can spread rapidly in human populations, especially in conditions lacking proper medical infrastructure. Prevention and control rely on surveillance, vector control, and public health measures.

## Highlights

- Significant decrease in both cases and deaths from Epidemic hemorrhagic fever observed from the peak years (2014-2021) to the current situation as of January 2024. <br/>
- The highest number of cases and deaths were recorded in November 2021, with a gradual decline to lower levels by January 2024. <br/>
- Seasonal fluctuations are evident, with cases generally peaking in late autumn and early winter months. <br/>
- The current disease situation as of January 2024 shows a controlled scenario with 511 cases and only 1 death.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 shows fluctuating patterns of cases reported annually, with a noticeable peak in cases during the late autumn to early winter months. Notably, a significant spike was observed in November 2017, with 2021 cases reported, and another in November 2021, with 2120 cases. These peaks suggest seasonal variations and potential influences of environmental or human factors. Over the years, there seems to be a gradual decrease in the number of cases, especially evident in the data from 2020 onwards, indicating possible improvements in public health interventions and awareness.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to EHF also exhibits variability, with the highest fatalities recorded in December 2017, amounting to 22 deaths. There's a noticeable annual pattern where deaths tend to increase during the winter months, correlating with the increase in cases. The overall trend in fatalities shows occasional spikes, such as in November 2018 with 33 deaths, which is the highest recorded in the given data. However, from 2020 onwards, there is a notable decrease in the number of deaths, which could be attributed to better medical care, earlier detection, and more effective treatment protocols for EHF.

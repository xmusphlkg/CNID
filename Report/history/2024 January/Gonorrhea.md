## Introduction

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It commonly affects mucous membranes, including the cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes in women, and the urethra in men and women. Symptoms may include painful urination and abnormal discharge from the genitals. However, many infected individuals may not exhibit symptoms, leading to undiagnosed and untreated cases. Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics, but untreated cases can result in serious health complications, including infertility. It is preventable through safe sexual practices and regular screenings.

## Highlights

- Steady increase in gonorrhea cases from 2014 to 2017, peaking in 2017 with significant growth, indicating a worsening epidemic during this period. <br/>
- A noticeable decline in cases in February 2020, likely due to COVID-19 related restrictions and changes in sexual behavior during the pandemic. <br/>
- After a brief pandemic-related decrease, case numbers began to recover, albeit with fluctuations, suggesting ongoing transmission challenges. <br/>
- The recent data as of January 2024 shows a slight decrease in cases to 9112, with a low but persistent presence of deaths, indicating the continued public health relevance of gonorrhea in Chinese mainland. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Gonorrhea in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 shows a fluctuating trend with overall growth in the number of cases over the years. Initially, cases rose from 8,034 in January 2014 to a peak of 13,803 in August 2017, indicating a growing spread. Subsequently, there was a notable decline in 2020, possibly due to COVID-19 related restrictions and healthcare shifts. However, cases rebounded post-2020, though not consistently surpassing previous peaks, suggesting variable control success. Seasonal variations are apparent, with drops often in early years and a general increasing trend toward the year-end, reflecting changing social behaviors or reporting practices.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths from Gonorrhea in Chinese mainland are extremely rare, as evidenced by the data, which records sporadic occurrences, totaling just a handful over the decade despite tens of thousands of cases annually. The few deaths reported (e.g., one in May 2014 and four in January 2020) could indicate severe complications or co-infections, highlighting potential areas for healthcare improvement. The overall low mortality rate suggests effective treatment and management for the majority of cases, although the reasons behind the specific peaks in mortality, like in January 2020, warrant further investigation to understand if they correlate with broader health system strains or specific epidemiological factors.

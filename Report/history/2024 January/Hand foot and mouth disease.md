## Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a contagious viral illness mainly affecting children under 5, though adults can catch it too. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, painful mouth sores, and a rash on hands and feet. It's caused by viruses like Coxsackievirus A16 and Enterovirus 71, spreading through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or feces. HFMD is typically mild, resolving in 7 to 10 days without treatment. The disease is prevalent in childcare settings, emphasizing the importance of good hygiene practices to prevent transmission.

## Highlights

- Significant seasonal patterns observed, with peaks in cases typically during warmer months (May to July), indicating a higher transmission rate during these periods. <br/>
- A dramatic reduction in cases and deaths from 2020 onwards, likely due to public health interventions and possibly changes in reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/>
- The highest number of cases recorded in June 2016 and July 2023, with 452,668 and 457,212 cases respectively, showcasing periodic spikes in infection rates. <br/>
- The number of deaths has significantly decreased over time, with no deaths reported from February 2023 onwards, suggesting improved disease management and prevention strategies.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows a significant fluctuation in the number of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) cases in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, with a peak observed annually around May to July, reflecting seasonal trends. Notably, there was a drastic decrease in cases starting from 2020, coinciding with the global COVID-19 pandemic, which likely resulted in increased hygiene practices and social distancing measures. The subsequent years demonstrate a gradual recovery in case numbers, yet they remain significantly lower than the pre-pandemic era, suggesting lasting changes in public health behavior or reporting practices.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from HFMD in Chinese mainland also presents a notable trend, with the highest numbers recorded in the peak years of 2014-2019, directly correlating with the high case counts. Deaths dramatically dropped to near zero starting from 2020, paralleling the decrease in case numbers. This reduction could be attributed to improved disease management, public health interventions, and possibly the impact of pandemic containment measures. The consistently low mortality rate in recent years highlights progress in HFMD control and treatment, even as case numbers begin to rise again post-pandemic.

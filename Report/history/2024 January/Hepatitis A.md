## Introduction

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). It's primarily transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food or water or close contact with an infected person. Symptoms can include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and jaundice, though not everyone infected will show symptoms. Vaccination can prevent the disease. Hepatitis A is more prevalent in regions with poor sanitation. While it can cause discomfort, most people recover fully with no lasting liver damage. Outbreaks can still occur in developed countries, emphasizing the importance of hygiene and vaccination.

## Highlights

1. Significant reduction in Hepatitis A cases from 1743 in January 2014 to 1002 in January 2024, indicating successful disease control.<br/>
2. Mortality rates have remained low, with many months reporting zero deaths, highlighting advancements in treatment and management.<br/>
3. The data shows a seasonal pattern in case numbers, with peaks in early months, suggesting seasonal impacts on transmission.<br/>
4. Overall, the trends suggest effective containment and management of Hepatitis A in the Chinese mainland, demonstrating the efficacy of health interventions and vaccination efforts.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Hepatitis A cases in Chinese mainland from January 2014 to January 2024 shows a general decreasing trend in the number of reported cases. Initially, cases fluctuated, peaking at 2733 in December 2014. A significant decrease is noticeable post-2019, with the numbers stabilizing below 1500 cases per month from 2020 onwards, and further dropping to around 1000 cases by 2024. This trend suggests effective measures might have been implemented to control the spread, possibly including improved vaccination coverage, better sanitation, and heightened public health awareness.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths due to Hepatitis A in the same period are remarkably low, indicating a low fatality rate for the disease in Chinese mainland. Deaths peaked at 4 in December 2015 but were generally sporadic and infrequent. The majority of months reported zero deaths, with occasional months reporting 1 or 2 deaths. This pattern underscores the effectiveness of the healthcare system in managing Hepatitis A cases, through timely diagnosis, treatment, and possibly widespread vaccination efforts that have helped minimize the disease's impact on mortality.

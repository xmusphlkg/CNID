## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. It is a major global health problem, leading to chronic liver disease and is a risk factor for liver cancer. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. The vaccine is 95% effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, making it the first line of defense in controlling the spread of the disease.

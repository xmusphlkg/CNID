## Introduction

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver, leading to inflammation. It's caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is transmitted through contaminated blood, such as through shared needles or unscreened blood transfusions. Many individuals with Hepatitis C may not exhibit symptoms initially, but chronic infection can lead to serious liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Diagnosis is through blood tests, and while there's no vaccine, antiviral medications can cure most cases. Preventive measures focus on reducing the risk of transmission.

## Highlights

- A dramatic increase in Hepatitis C-related deaths from April 2023, peaking in December with 393 deaths, despite relatively stable case numbers. <br/>
- Significant decrease in reported cases and deaths in January 2024, indicating a potential improvement in the disease situation or changes in reporting. <br/>
- A notable surge in cases and deaths in the latter half of 2022, with deaths particularly escalating in August 2022, highlighting a concerning trend in disease severity or fatality rate. <br/>
- Fluctuations in monthly reported cases over the years, with a general increase in the early years followed by more variability and a recent alarming rise in mortality rates.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from 2014 to 2024 for Hepatitis C cases in mainland China shows a fluctuating trend with a noticeable increase in reported cases around March each year, possibly due to enhanced surveillance or seasonal factors influencing testing and diagnosis rates. The significant drop in cases in February 2020 coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic onset, affecting healthcare priorities and access. The recent years, especially 2022 onwards, indicate a concerning surge in cases, peaking significantly in 2023, suggesting potential changes in transmission dynamics, increased awareness, or improvements in diagnostic capabilities.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from Hepatitis C in mainland China remained relatively low and stable from 2014 to 2021, with deaths rarely exceeding 20 per month despite fluctuations in case numbers. However, a dramatic increase in fatalities is observed starting in August 2022, culminating in a stark rise through 2023, with deaths in December reaching 393. This surge in mortality could be attributed to several factors, including the progression of untreated or inadequately treated cases to severe liver disease, changes in the virus's virulence, or possibly a lag in the healthcare system's ability to manage the increasing case load effectively.

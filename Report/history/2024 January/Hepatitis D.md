## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as delta hepatitis, is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication. HDV infection can occur simultaneously with HBV (co-infection) or in those already infected with HBV (superinfection). It can lead to more severe liver complications compared to HBV alone, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Transmission routes include contact with infected blood, unsafe injection practices, and from mother to child during childbirth. Vaccination against hepatitis B offers protection against hepatitis D, as it prevents HBV infection, thereby indirectly preventing HDV infection.

## Highlights

- A significant decline in reported cases from 2016 to 2024, with initial monthly cases around 40-60 dropping to 10-25 in later years.<br/>
- No reported deaths from Hepatitis D throughout the provided timeline, indicating either effective management of cases or underreporting.<br/>
- A noticeable drop in case numbers starting in 2020, possibly due to public health interventions or changes in reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>
- As of January 2024, there is a slight increase in cases (25 reported), suggesting a need for continued surveillance and prevention efforts.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data for Hepatitis D cases in Chinese mainland from January 2016 to January 2024 shows fluctuations, with a noticeable decline from the beginning of 2020. The peak occurrences in May 2017 and September 2017, each reporting 59 cases, contrast sharply with a significant decrease in cases observed from February 2020 onwards, reaching as low as 10 cases in October and November 2022. This trend suggests a potential effectiveness of public health interventions and awareness programs. However, the slight increase in cases towards January 2024, reporting 25 cases, indicates the need for continued vigilance and prevention strategies.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the observed period from January 2016 to January 2024, the reported death toll from Hepatitis D in Chinese mainland has remained at zero. This consistent lack of mortality could indicate effective clinical management and treatment of diagnosed cases, reflecting well on the healthcare infrastructure's ability to manage Hepatitis D. It also suggests that while Hepatitis D infections have been present, the interventions in place have successfully prevented fatalities. This data underscores the importance of maintaining and possibly enhancing current health measures to continue this success in managing Hepatitis D outcomes.

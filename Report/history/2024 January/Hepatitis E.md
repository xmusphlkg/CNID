## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV), primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water. It presents symptoms similar to other forms of viral hepatitis, including jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain. While most cases resolve spontaneously, it can cause severe complications, particularly in pregnant women and those with pre-existing liver conditions. Globally, it's a significant cause of acute viral hepatitis, with outbreaks more common in regions with poor sanitation. Vaccines are available in some countries, but public health measures remain key to prevention.

## Highlights

- Seasonal variation in cases is evident, with peaks typically in March-April and a secondary peak in the latter part of the year. <br/>
- A notable decrease in cases and deaths was observed in 2020, likely due to interventions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/>
- Overall, there has been a gradual increase in both cases and deaths from Hepatitis E from 2014 to 2024, with the highest number of deaths (4) recorded in January 2024. <br/>
- The data suggests a need for continued surveillance and public health measures to address Hepatitis E in the Chinese mainland.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Hepatitis E cases in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 shows fluctuations, with peaks often in March-April and a general trend of increase over the years, peaking in 2023-2024. The lowest recorded cases were in December 2022, with a significant drop possibly due to public health interventions or reporting discrepancies. Seasonal variations are evident, with higher cases in warmer months, suggesting possible links to environmental factors or foodborne transmission routes typical for Hepatitis E.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from Hepatitis E during the same period remains relatively low compared to the number of cases, indicating a low fatality rate. The highest mortality was seen in December 2017, with 6 deaths. Deaths do not show a clear seasonal pattern, suggesting that fatalities may be more related to individual health conditions, access to healthcare, or variations in the virulence of the circulating strains. The overall low mortality rate underscores the importance of prevention and effective clinical management of cases.

## Introduction

Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, usually caused by viral infections but also by other factors like alcohol use, certain medications, and autoimmune diseases. There are five main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D, and E. These types differ in their modes of transmission, severity, and geographical distribution. Hepatitis can manifest in either acute or chronic forms. Acute hepatitis is often short-term, while chronic hepatitis can lead to long-term health issues, including liver cirrhosis and cancer. Vaccines are available for types A, B, and E.

## Highlights

- Hepatitis cases in China have risen from 2014 to 2024, peaking at 159,136 cases in January 2024, indicating an upward trend. <br/>
- Mortality rates saw significant fluctuations, with a stark increase in deaths from May to December 2023, then a sudden drop in January 2024, pointing to changes in disease management. <br/>
- The surge in deaths between May and November 2023 suggests possible emergence of a more virulent strain or improved detection. <br/>
- The data highlights a growing hepatitis prevalence in China, emphasizing the need for enhanced public health measures. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, hepatitis cases in the Chinese mainland showed significant fluctuations, with a general upward trend over the years. The data reveal periodic peaks, notably in March 2017, March 2018, March 2019, and a sharp increase from March 2023 onwards, reaching a peak in August 2023. The sudden drop in cases in February 2020 likely reflects the impact of COVID-19 measures. The marked increase in cases starting from March 2023 suggests a potential outbreak or reduced effectiveness of preventive measures.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to hepatitis in the Chinese mainland remained relatively stable and low from 2014 to early 2020, with a notable spike in January 2020. However, from 2023 onwards, there was a dramatic increase in fatalities, peaking in December 2023 with 428 deaths. This surge in deaths might indicate the emergence of a more virulent strain of hepatitis or a lapse in healthcare management and intervention strategies. The sudden decrease in deaths in January 2024 requires further investigation to understand its cause and sustainability.

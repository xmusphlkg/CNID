## Introduction

The H7N9 virus is a subtype of the influenza virus that primarily affects birds but can occasionally infect humans. The first human cases were reported in China in March 2013. Human infections with H7N9 are rare, but when they occur, they can lead to severe respiratory illness and even death. The virus is thought to spread to humans through direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, or contaminated environments. There is currently no evidence to suggest that H7N9 can be transmitted from person to person effectively.

## Highlights

- Significant peaks in H7N9 cases and deaths were observed in early years, with the highest number of cases (192) and deaths (79) reported in January 2017. <br/>
- A rapid decline in H7N9 cases and deaths was evident post-2017, reaching zero cases and deaths consistently from January 2018 onwards. <br/>
- The absence of reported cases and deaths from 2018 through January 2024 suggests effective control measures and surveillance. <br/>
- The data indicates successful mitigation of the H7N9 virus in the Chinese mainland as of January 2024.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The H7N9 virus in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 shows a significant fluctuation in case numbers. Initially high in 2014, with 127 cases in January alone, there was a notable decrease over time. A resurgence occurred in 2017, peaking at 192 cases in January, suggesting a possible mutation or seasonal pattern. Post-2017, cases drastically reduced, eventually dropping to zero from July 2019 onwards. This decline could be attributed to effective public health interventions, increased awareness, and possibly the development of herd immunity or an effective vaccine.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from H7N9 in this period mirrors the trend in case numbers. The highest fatalities occurred in early years, with February 2014 recording 41 deaths. A significant spike in deaths was observed in early 2017, with January seeing 79 deaths, the highest in the dataset. The reduction in deaths post-2017, leading to zero fatalities from July 2019, is indicative of improved medical treatments, early detection, and effective containment measures. The data suggests successful control of the virus, leading to the cessation of both cases and fatalities in later years.

## Introduction

Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is a severe parasitic disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, transmitted through the bites of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. This disease primarily affects the internal organs, such as the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, leading to fever, weight loss, anemia, and enlargement of the spleen and liver. If left untreated, kala-azar can be fatal. It is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Effective treatment involves antiparasitic medications.

## Highlights

- Observations show a peak in Kala azar cases in late 2015, followed by fluctuating but generally decreasing trends. <br/>
- Mortality remains low, with few deaths annually, indicating effective case management. <br/>
- The recent uptick to 33 cases in January 2024 suggests possible seasonal variation or an emerging cluster, yet no deaths reported. <br/>
- The data underscores the need for ongoing surveillance and response strategies to manage and mitigate Kala azar's impact in China.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reveals a fluctuating trend in Kala azar cases in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, with a notable peak in 2015 October (113 cases) and a general decline thereafter. Seasonal variations are evident, with cases typically increasing in the warmer months, reflecting the vector-borne nature of the disease. The data indicates successful interventions or natural fluctuations in vector populations, with occasional spikes suggesting outbreaks or increased transmission periods. Overall, the trend suggests a managed situation but underscores the need for continuous surveillance and preventive measures.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from Kala azar in Chinese mainland remains remarkably low throughout the observed period, totaling only 5 confirmed deaths despite the fluctuations in case numbers. This low mortality rate may be attributed to effective diagnosis, timely treatment, and possibly the implementation of control measures against the sandfly vector. However, the presence of deaths, even if minimal, highlights the potential for fatality associated with Kala azar, underscoring the importance of maintaining robust health infrastructure and awareness programs to prevent and manage cases effectively.

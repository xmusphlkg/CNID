## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium leprae*. Primarily affecting the skin, nerves, respiratory tract, and eyes, it can lead to significant disability and disfigurement if untreated. Transmission is believed to occur through close contact with an infected person, although the exact mechanism is not fully understood. Leprosy is characterized by long incubation periods, which can last up to 20 years. While it is curable with a course of multidrug therapy, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term damage.

## Highlights

- **Declining trend in cases**: A noticeable decrease in new leprosy cases from 2014 to 2024, indicating effective control and public health efforts. <br/>
- **Low mortality rate**: Very few deaths reported, highlighting the disease's manageability with proper treatment. <br/>
- **Seasonal fluctuations observed**: Case numbers fluctuate across months without a clear pattern, suggesting variable transmission rates. <br/>
- **Effective management**: The trend and low mortality rate suggest successful management strategies, including early detection and treatment.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows a fluctuating trend in leprosy cases in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, with a notable peak in March 2016 (108 cases). There's a general decrease in cases over the years, particularly noticeable from 2018 onwards, with a significant drop in 2022 and maintaining lower levels into 2024. This trend may reflect successful interventions, increased awareness, and improved treatment and diagnosis methodologies. However, the slight variations in monthly cases indicate the need for continuous monitoring and targeted health strategies to further control and eventually eliminate leprosy in the region.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths from leprosy in Chinese mainland are extremely rare, with only three occurrences over the ten-year span: one in January 2016, another in August 2019, and the last one in December 2021. This low mortality rate is indicative of effective treatment and management of the disease, highlighting the success of the public health strategies in place. Nonetheless, the presence of deaths, even in such small numbers, underscores the importance of sustained efforts in leprosy detection, treatment, and education to prevent mortality and further reduce the incidence of the disease.

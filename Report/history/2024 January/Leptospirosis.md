## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection primarily transmitted to humans through contact with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals, notably rodents. Caused by the spirochete bacteria *Leptospira*, it can manifest a wide range of symptoms, from mild flu-like signs to severe illness, including liver damage, kidney failure, and meningitis. The disease is global but more common in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. Diagnosis involves laboratory tests, and treatment usually includes antibiotics. Preventive measures include avoiding contaminated water and vaccination in high-risk areas.

## Highlights

- Seasonal variability is evident, with cases peaking in the warmer months (June to October), indicating a potential link to environmental factors conducive to the bacteria's spread. <br/>
- The data shows an overall fluctuating trend in the number of leptospirosis cases, with significant outbreaks observed in certain years (e.g., December 2014 and September 2021). <br/>
- Mortality associated with leptospirosis remains low, but sporadic deaths highlight the potential severity of the infection. <br/>
- The latest data from January 2024 shows a slight increase in cases to 19, suggesting continued vigilance is necessary to control and prevent leptospirosis outbreaks.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Leptospirosis in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to January 2024 reveals a clear seasonal pattern, with cases peaking annually between July and October. The highest recorded month was December 2014, with 207 cases. This period likely corresponds to the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, which are conducive to the spread of Leptospirosis due to flooding and increased contact with contaminated water. The overall trend indicates fluctuating but persistent incidence of the disease, underscoring the need for continued surveillance, preventive measures, and public health interventions, especially in flood-prone areas.

### Deaths Analysis
The death records from Leptospirosis cases over the same period show a relatively low fatality rate, with a total of 27 recorded deaths. The majority of these deaths occurred in the peak months of infection, specifically from July to October, with the highest fatalities in September 2020 and 2021, suggesting a possible correlation between case load and mortality. However, the mortality rate does not significantly spike even in months with the highest case counts, indicating effective clinical management and possibly early detection of cases. It emphasizes the importance of healthcare access and awareness about the disease for timely intervention and reducing fatalities.

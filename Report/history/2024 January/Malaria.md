## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It manifests as fever, headaches, and chills, potentially advancing to severe illness and death if not treated. Predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, malaria poses significant health risks in many countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Efforts to control malaria include preventive measures like bed nets and insecticides, as well as treatment with antimalarial medications. Despite these efforts, malaria remains a major global health challenge, affecting millions annually.

## Highlights

- **Notable decrease over a decade:** Malaria cases and deaths in the Chinese mainland have significantly declined from 2014 to 2024, indicating effective control measures. <br/>
- **Dramatic drop post-2020:** From 2020, cases and deaths substantially reduced, suggesting intensified control efforts or broader health interventions. <br/>
- **Spike in August 2022:** An unexpected increase in cases occurred in August 2022, highlighting a potential but well-managed outbreak. <br/>
- **Gradual increase recently:** After the 2020 drop, cases have been slowly rising from 2022 to January 2024, emphasizing the need for continuous vigilance and control efforts.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data show a significant decrease in malaria cases in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, with initial numbers ranging from 169 to 386 cases per month in the earlier years to a dramatic reduction to as low as 26 to 254 cases in the later years. The decline becomes particularly noticeable from 2020 onwards, indicating effective control measures and interventions. Seasonal variations persist, with peaks generally in the warmer months, reflecting typical malaria transmission patterns.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to malaria in the Chinese mainland have also seen a decrease, aligning with the reduction in case numbers. Initially, monthly deaths varied, with some months recording higher fatalities (up to 5 deaths). However, from 2020 onwards, there is a significant drop, with many months reporting zero deaths. This reduction in mortality can be attributed to improved case management, prompt treatment, and possibly better access to healthcare facilities. The data show a successful reduction in both morbidity and mortality from malaria over the decade.

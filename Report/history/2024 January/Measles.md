## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection, marked by symptoms that include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in children under 5 and adults over 20, such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and blindness. Vaccination is highly effective in preventing measles. Despite global vaccination efforts, measles remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in areas with low vaccination coverage.

## Highlights

- Significant decline in measles cases from a peak in 2014 to a consistent low by January 2024, illustrating effective control measures. <br/>
- The mortality rate dropped to zero from 2020 onwards, indicating improved clinical management and possibly higher vaccination coverage. <br/>
- A noticeable trend towards stabilization of cases in the low double digits in recent years, suggesting sustained transmission at lower levels. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, the general trajectory shows successful measles suppression, highlighting the effectiveness of public health interventions in China.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows a significant decline in measles cases in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024. The initial years (2014-2016) experienced high numbers, peaking in April 2014 with 11,089 cases. A dramatic decrease is observed post-2016, transitioning to triple-digit figures by 2017, and further declining to double-digit figures by 2020. This trend continued, with occasional minor surges, stabilizing at low levels towards the latest years. The consistent decrease over the years signifies effective control measures, possibly including improved vaccination coverage, public health interventions, and heightened awareness.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths due to measles saw a reduction to zero from August 2014 onwards, with occasional fluctuations in the earlier years. Notably, deaths were only recorded until February 2016, after which no deaths were reported. The initial period (2014-2016) showed a correlation between the number of cases and deaths, albeit the fatality rate was low. The complete cessation of reported deaths from March 2016 onwards highlights the effectiveness of the healthcare response in managing and preventing complications arising from measles, likely reflecting advancements in medical treatment, increased immunization rates, and stronger surveillance systems.

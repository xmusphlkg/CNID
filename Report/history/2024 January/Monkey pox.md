## Introduction

Monkeypox is a viral zoonosis with symptoms similar to smallpox, although clinically less severe. It is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus in the Poxviridae family. The disease was first identified in humans in 1970. Transmission can occur through contact with infected animals, humans, or materials contaminated with the virus. Human symptoms include fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. Monkeypox predominantly occurs in Central and West African regions but has seen outbreaks in other parts of the world. Vaccination against smallpox has been shown to be highly effective in preventing monkeypox.

## Highlights

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
在中国大陆的猴痘疫情数据显示，从2023年9月至2024年1月，病例数呈现先增后减的趋势。9月份报告了80例病例，10月份增至127例，标志着疫情的加剧。然而，此后病例数有所下降，11月回落至80例，12月为102例，2024年1月降至97例。这一波动可能受多种因素影响，包括公共卫生干预措施的效果、病毒传播模式的变化或是群体免疫力的提高。

### Deaths Analysis
值得关注的是，尽管猴痘病例在这段时间内波动，但报告的死亡人数为零。这一现象可能反映了几个关键因素：首先，可能与猴痘的致死率相对较低有关；其次，可能说明中国大陆的医疗体系在诊断和治疗猴痘方面相对有效，能够及时控制病情，避免导致死亡。此外，这也可能表示有效的公共卫生干预和疫苗接种策略在预防严重疾病和死亡方面起到了作用。

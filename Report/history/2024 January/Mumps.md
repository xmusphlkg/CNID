## Introduction

Mumps is a contagious viral infection characterized by painful swelling of the salivary glands, typically the parotid glands located near the ears, leading to a distinctive puffy-cheek appearance. Other symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Mumps spreads through infected saliva, via coughing, sneezing, or sharing items. While vaccines, particularly the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, have significantly reduced its incidence, outbreaks can still occur, especially in settings where people have close contact. Complications are rare but can include meningitis, encephalitis, and hearing loss.

## Highlights

- A significant reduction in mumps cases from a peak in 2019 to a notable low in January 2024, indicating a downward trend in infections. <br/>
- The highest reported cases were in June 2019 with 37,913 cases, showcasing a peak in mumps activity during this period. <br/>
- A sharp decline in cases is observed from 2020 onwards, particularly post the COVID-19 pandemic onset, suggesting possible impacts of enhanced public health measures. <br/>
- Deaths are extremely rare, with sporadic occurrences, indicating a low mortality rate associated with mumps in the Chinese mainland.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data for Mumps in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 shows fluctuating case numbers with a general upward trend until 2019, peaking at 37,913 cases in June 2019. Following 2019, there's a noticeable decline in cases, particularly from 2020 onwards, coinciding with the global COVID-19 pandemic. This decline could be attributed to increased hygiene practices, social distancing, and possibly disruptions in reporting. The lowest recorded cases are in January 2024, with 5,272 cases, indicating a significant decrease in mumps incidence or changes in public health interventions and reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
The data indicates a very low mortality rate associated with mumps, with deaths being a rare occurrence throughout the reported period. A total of 11 deaths were reported from 2014 to 2024, with a maximum of 4 deaths in January 2020. The sporadic reporting of deaths may reflect the generally non-lethal nature of mumps due to effective vaccination programs and treatments. However, the presence of deaths underscores the potential complications of mumps, such as encephalitis and meningitis, which can be fatal. The data suggests that while mumps is predominantly a non-fatal disease, vigilance in vaccination and healthcare provision remains crucial.

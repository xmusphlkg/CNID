## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to forms of liver inflammation that don't fall under the well-known categories of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. These types can result from various causes, including autoimmune disorders, medications, toxins, and less common viruses. Unlike the more familiar forms, which are primarily viral, other hepatitis types often require different diagnostic approaches and treatments. Understanding and identifying these less common forms are crucial for effective management and care, as their causes, and consequently their treatments, may significantly differ from viral hepatitis, emphasizing the need for comprehensive liver health assessment.

## Highlights

1. **Decreasing Trend**: Cases of Other hepatitis in Chinese mainland reduced from 3041 in January 2014 to 630 in January 2024, showing a significant decline over a decade. <br/>
2. **Low Mortality**: The death rate remained low, suggesting effective disease management or a milder disease form. <br/>
3. **Stabilization in Recent Years**: Post-2020, the case count has stabilized, indicating a persistent but controlled disease presence. <br/>
4. **2020 Drop**: A sharp decrease in cases in early 2020 may reflect the impact of COVID-19 public health measures. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for "Other hepatitis" in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 shows a general decreasing trend in the number of reported cases. Initially, the numbers were relatively high, with over 3000 cases at the beginning of 2014. There was a fluctuation in the subsequent years, but the overall trend has been towards a decrease, culminating in significantly lower numbers by 2024, with 630 cases in January. This trend could indicate improved preventive measures, better healthcare policies, or changes in reporting practices over the years.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths from "Other hepatitis" over the same period exhibit a low and relatively stable pattern, with monthly deaths rarely exceeding 2 and often reporting no deaths at all. This stability in mortality, despite the fluctuating number of cases, suggests that the condition, while still present, has not significantly impacted mortality rates. It could reflect improvements in medical treatment and management of the disease. The overall low mortality rate associated with "Other hepatitis" cases in this dataset is a positive sign, pointing towards effective healthcare interventions and possibly increased public awareness and vaccination rates.

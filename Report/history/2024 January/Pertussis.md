## Introduction

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It's characterized by severe coughing spells that can result in a "whooping" sound when the person breathes in. While it can affect individuals of any age, it's particularly dangerous for infants and young children. Vaccination has significantly reduced its incidence, but outbreaks still occur, mainly affecting those not fully vaccinated. Early symptoms resemble a common cold, progressing to more severe coughing episodes. Treatment often involves antibiotics to prevent the spread of the infection.

## Highlights

- Pertussis cases in China have shown a significant upward trend, peaking at 15,275 cases with 5 deaths in January 2024. <br/>
- After a brief decline in cases during 2020, likely due to pandemic-related measures, there has been a consistent increase in cases and fatalities from 2021 onwards. <br/>
- The highest number of deaths in a single month was reported in January 2024, indicating a concerning escalation in both incidence and severity of the disease. <br/>
- This data highlights the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, vaccination, and public health interventions to address the rising trend of Pertussis in the Chinese mainland.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from Chinese mainland shows a significant upward trend in Pertussis cases from 2014 to 2024, with a marked increase in the number of cases over the years. The data highlights sporadic peaks, notably in 2018, 2019, and a sharp rise in 2023 leading into 2024. The steep increase in January 2024, with 15,275 cases, suggests an alarming escalation. This pattern indicates not only seasonal fluctuations but also points to potential gaps in vaccination coverage, public health response, or emerging strains of the bacteria.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths due to Pertussis in the same period are notably low, with a total of 17 deaths over a decade, despite the substantial increase in cases. This low mortality rate could reflect improvements in healthcare access, early detection, and effective treatment of cases. However, the slight increase in deaths in recent months, especially January 2024 with five deaths, underscores the need for continued vigilance, improved vaccination efforts, and targeted public health interventions to prevent fatalities associated with Pertussis.

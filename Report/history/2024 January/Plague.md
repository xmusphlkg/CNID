## Introduction

Plague is a serious bacterial infection caused by *Yersinia pestis*, transmitted to humans through the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected animals, or inhalation of infected respiratory droplets. Historically notorious for causing several pandemics, including the Black Death in the 14th century, it presents in three forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, each varying in symptoms and severity. Despite its historical lethality, modern antibiotics have made plague treatable, significantly reducing mortality rates. However, outbreaks still occur, emphasizing the importance of surveillance and preventive measures in at-risk areas.

## Highlights

- Plague occurrences in the Chinese mainland are infrequent, with isolated cases and deaths over the years. <br/>
- A peak of 4 cases was noted in November 2019 and August 2023, hinting at minor outbreaks or enhanced detection. <br/>
- The case fatality rate often equals the number of cases, indicating high lethality among detected infections. <br/>
- No cases or deaths were reported in January 2024, suggesting a current pause in plague activity in the region.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows sporadic cases of plague in China from 2014 to 2024, with a total of 19 reported cases. Notably, there were no cases in most months, with occasional spikes, such as 4 cases in November 2019 and 4 in August 2023. The pattern suggests isolated incidents rather than widespread outbreaks. These cases could be attributed to specific local factors, such as contact with infected animals or fleas, given the plague's zoonotic nature.

### Deaths Analysis
The data reveals a total of 9 deaths associated with the plague over the same period, indicating a high case-fatality rate for the reported cases. Deaths occurred in July 2014, October 2014, December 2017, September 2019, January 2020, August 2020, August 2023, and September 2022. The fatality rate suggests that either cases were identified late or they were severe, possibly pneumonic or septicaemic plague, which are more deadly if not treated promptly.

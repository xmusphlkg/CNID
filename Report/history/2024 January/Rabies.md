## Introduction

Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system, leading to acute encephalitis in warm-blooded animals. The rabies virus is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, with dogs being the most common transmitter to humans globally. Once symptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal. Symptoms include fever, muscle weakness, and fear of water. Preventive measures are crucial and include vaccination of animals and post-exposure prophylaxis for humans. Early treatment after exposure can prevent the onset of symptoms and death.

## Highlights

- A significant decline in both rabies cases and deaths from 2014 to 2024, highlighting successful control measures. <br/>
- The peak of cases (105) and deaths (108) occurred in 2014, with a gradual reduction to 15 cases and 11 deaths by January 2024. <br/>
- Seasonal fluctuations are evident, with higher numbers typically reported in the warmer months, though overall trends show a substantial decrease over the decade. <br/>
- Despite the marked improvement, the persistence of cases into 2024 underscores the need for continued vaccination and public health efforts.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, rabies cases in Chinese mainland showed a general downward trend, with a noticeable peak in September 2014 (105 cases) and a gradual decline thereafter. The highest number of cases in the early years gradually decreased, reaching lower levels by 2023 and 2024. This decline could be attributed to improved vaccination rates, public awareness campaigns, and better control and prevention measures. Despite fluctuations, the data indicates effective strategies in combating rabies over the decade.

### Deaths Analysis
Rabies deaths followed a similar declining trend as cases over the same period, with initial high numbers gradually decreasing. The peak death toll in January 2014 (108 deaths) highlights the severe impact of rabies at the start of the period. The subsequent decrease in deaths, with occasional spikes, suggests improvements in medical treatment, post-exposure prophylaxis, and overall management of rabies exposure. The reduction in both cases and deaths over time underscores the effectiveness of sustained public health interventions.

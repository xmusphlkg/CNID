## Introduction

Scarlet fever is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Streptococcus pyogenes*, which is also responsible for strep throat. Characterized by a distinctive red rash that feels like sandpaper, the illness typically affects children aged 5 to 15 years. Other symptoms include a high fever, sore throat, and a red, bumpy tongue known as "strawberry tongue." Scarlet fever spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. While historically considered severe, it's now treatable with antibiotics, which can prevent most complications when administered promptly. Vaccination and hygiene practices are key in preventing its spread.

## Highlights

- Scarlet fever cases in Chinese mainland show fluctuating trends, with peaks in mid-year months of 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019, and a notable decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic years (2020-2023). <br/>
- A significant resurgence in cases is observed in January 2024 (6255 cases), marking a possible seasonal spike or broader resurgence. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations and recent increases, deaths remain extremely rare, highlighting the disease's manageable nature with proper treatment. <br/>
- Continuous surveillance and public health measures are crucial for managing Scarlet fever trends and mitigating its impact. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Scarlet fever in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 shows fluctuating trends, with notable peaks in June 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, each exceeding 10,000 cases. A significant decrease is observed in 2020, coinciding with the global COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a drastic reduction in cases to below 3,000 by December 2020. This trend of reduced cases continues into the following years, with a gradual increase starting from 2023, indicating a potential resurgence. The pattern suggests seasonality with annual peaks around June and a notable impact of public health measures in 2020.

### Deaths Analysis
The dataset reveals a remarkably low fatality rate associated with Scarlet fever in the Chinese mainland, with only two reported deaths over the entire period. The first death occurred in April 2015, and the second in September 2020, despite the varying number of cases annually. This low mortality rate underscores the effectiveness of treatment and management strategies for Scarlet fever. However, the presence of deaths despite generally low mortality rates emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and prompt treatment, especially considering the disease's potential for resurgence as indicated by the increasing case numbers in the latter years of the dataset.

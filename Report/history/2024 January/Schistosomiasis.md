## Introduction

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a disease caused by parasitic worms from the genus Schistosoma. Transmitted through exposure to freshwater contaminated with the worms' larvae, which originate from infected snails, it primarily affects the urinary tract or intestines. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Chronic infection may lead to liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. Schistosomiasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in communities lacking access to safe water and sanitation.

## Highlights

- **Significant reduction in cases**: From thousands of cases in the mid-2010s to single digits by 2024, indicating effective control measures. <br/>
- **Peak in 2015**: A dramatic spike in cases occurred in 2015, with November reaching over 10,000 cases, highlighting a critical outbreak period. <br/>
- **Zero deaths in recent years**: Despite the fluctuation in case numbers, there have been no reported deaths from Schistosomiasis in Chinese mainland since a single death reported in February 2020. <br/>
- **Stable low transmission**: Since 2020, the transmission has remained at a low level, with cases mostly in the single digits, indicating sustained control efforts.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows fluctuating patterns of Schistosomiasis cases in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024. Initially, cases were moderate but surged significantly in 2015, with the peak reaching 10,481 cases in November. Following this peak, there was a dramatic decrease in cases from 2016 onwards, with sporadic outbreaks, notably in 2017 with a peak of 3,144 cases in October. From 2018, the number of cases drastically reduced, stabilizing at low levels towards 2024. This trend indicates effective control measures and public health interventions targeting Schistosomiasis transmission vectors and improved access to medical treatment.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the observed period, Schistosomiasis deaths remained exceedingly rare, with the data recording a single death in February 2020. This isolated incident notwithstanding, the absence of fatalities in the remaining timeframe underscores the effectiveness of public health strategies in managing the disease. It suggests that, although Schistosomiasis can have a significant morbidity impact, with timely and adequate medical care, mortality risk is minimal. This highlights the importance of sustained public health efforts, including disease surveillance, prompt treatment, and educational campaigns to maintain low mortality rates from Schistosomiasis.

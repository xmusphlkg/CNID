## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. This infection progresses through multiple stages, including primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary phases, each with distinct symptoms. Initial symptoms may include a painless sore at the infection site, followed by rashes and other systemic manifestations. If untreated, syphilis can lead to severe health complications affecting the heart, brain, and other organs. Transmission primarily occurs through sexual contact, but it can also be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, leading to congenital syphilis. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics are essential for effective management.

## Highlights

- Steady increase in syphilis cases observed from 2014 to 2024, highlighting an ongoing public health concern in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, a noticeable uptick in cases is evident in the later years, particularly from 2020 onwards, suggesting the need for enhanced surveillance and intervention strategies. <br/>
- The number of deaths remains relatively low compared to the number of cases, indicating effective treatment options are available, yet the rising case numbers emphasize the importance of preventive measures. <br/>
- The data for January 2024 shows 56,658 cases with 6 deaths, underscoring a persistent challenge in controlling syphilis transmission despite advancements in healthcare.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from 2014 to 2024 for syphilis cases in Chinese mainland shows a fluctuating yet overall increasing trend. Initially, cases ranged around the 30,000 to 40,000 mark per month, with some variability. However, from 2019 onwards, there's a noticeable increase, with cases often exceeding 50,000 per month by 2023. This rise indicates that despite ongoing efforts, syphilis remains a significant public health challenge in the region. Seasonal variations are minimal, suggesting that the disease's transmission is relatively consistent throughout the year.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll associated with syphilis in Chinese mainland presents a varied pattern, with numbers generally low, reflecting the treatable nature of the disease when identified early. Deaths per month rarely exceed 10, with an unusual spike to 25 deaths in January 2020. This spike could be attributed to specific epidemiological factors or reporting anomalies. From 2017 onwards, the fatality numbers remain consistently low, with occasional fluctuations. The overall low mortality rate underscores the importance of early detection and treatment in managing syphilis effectively.

## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious disease primarily affecting the lungs, caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Despite being preventable and curable, TB remains one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases. Symptoms include persistent cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. The disease can be latent, showing no symptoms, or active, leading to serious health issues. Diagnosis involves skin tests, blood tests, and chest X-rays, with treatment requiring a long course of antibiotics. Global efforts focus on vaccination, diagnosis, treatment, and reducing transmission.

## Highlights

- A significant decrease in tuberculosis cases from a peak in 2014 (118,849 cases) to 60,660 cases in January 2024, showing a successful reduction over a decade. <br/>
- Despite the reduction in cases, mortality has alarmingly increased from 183 deaths in April 2014 to 383 in January 2024, indicating a need for improved treatment outcomes. <br/>
- A notable dip in cases and deaths in 2020, likely due to COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts. <br/>
- From 2022, mortality rates have more than doubled, marking a concerning upward trend and highlighting a critical area for public health intervention.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from Chinese mainland shows a fluctuating trend in tuberculosis cases from 2014 to 2024, with initial numbers around 96,067 in January 2014, peaking at 118,849 in April 2014. A noticeable decline occurs from 2020, attributed possibly to enhanced public health measures. The lowest recorded cases are in December 2022 (33,951), suggesting effective interventions or reporting changes. The resurgence in 2023, peaking at 76,331 in March, followed by a slight decrease, indicates the dynamic nature of tuberculosis transmission and the impact of public health strategies over time.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to tuberculosis in the same period exhibit a generally increasing trend, from 155 in January 2014 to a peak of 416 in December 2023. The sharp increase in fatalities from 2021 onwards, with deaths more than doubling from January 2021 (137) to January 2022 (304), suggests a worsening severity or detection of cases. The fluctuation in death rates, especially the dramatic rise in the last reported year, underscores the need for continued vigilance, improved treatment strategies, and comprehensive public health policies to combat tuberculosis effectively.

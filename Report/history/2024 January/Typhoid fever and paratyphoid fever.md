## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are bacterial infections caused by *Salmonella Typhi* and *Salmonella Paratyphi*, respectively. These diseases are transmitted through contaminated food and water, leading to symptoms such as high fever, weakness, stomach pains, headache, and loss of appetite. In some cases, a rash of flat, rose-colored spots may appear. These fevers are more common in areas with poor sanitation and lack of clean water. Vaccination, safe food and water practices, and antibiotics are key to prevention and treatment. Typhoid can be severe or fatal if not treated promptly.

## Highlights

- Significant decrease in cases of Typhoid and Paratyphoid fever from 2014 to 2024, indicating effective control measures and improved public health infrastructure. <br/>
- Low mortality rate throughout the years, with sporadic deaths, suggests high recovery rates and effective treatment protocols. <br/>
- Seasonal fluctuations in case numbers, with peaks generally in the warmer months, suggest a pattern related to climatic conditions or seasonal human activity. <br/>
- Recent years show a sustained decrease in both cases and deaths, highlighting ongoing success in disease management and prevention strategies. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows a fluctuating trend in the number of Typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases in China from 2014 to 2024, with a noticeable peak during the summer months, likely due to increased bacterial proliferation in warmer conditions. The highest case count was observed in September 2014 with 1787 cases. A significant decline is evident from 2020 onwards, which could be attributed to improved hygiene practices, possibly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic response measures, and better access to clean water and medical care.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality data associated with Typhoid and paratyphoid fever in China from 2014 to 2024 reveals a very low death rate, with only a few reported deaths despite thousands of cases each year. This low mortality rate could indicate effective medical treatment and vaccination efforts. However, there were isolated spikes in deaths in some years, such as in June 2017 with three deaths, suggesting possible outbreaks or cases with complications. The overall trend suggests that while Typhoid and paratyphoid fever remain a public health concern, fatalities are rare and preventable with timely medical intervention.

## Introduction

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It interferes with the body's ability to fight infections and diseases. HIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells, which are essential for a healthy immune function. The disease is primarily transmitted through sexual intercourse, sharing needles, or from mother to child during birth. The advanced stage of the HIV infection is known as AIDS. Despite significant medical advancements, AIDS remains a global health crisis without a definitive cure but can be managed with proper treatment.

## Highlights

- Gradual increase in AIDS cases and deaths from 2010 to 2023, highlighting ongoing transmission and disease burden in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
- Notable peaks in reports during year-end, particularly in November and December, suggesting seasonal or reporting trends. <br/>
- December 2018 recorded the highest figures, with 7897 cases and 2444 deaths, indicating a surge in the epidemicâ€™s impact. <br/>
- Latest data from November 2023 shows 5664 cases and 1955 deaths, maintaining an elevated but consistent level of disease prevalence. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the 2010-2023 period, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases in mainland China show marked fluctuations yet an overall upward trend. A modest start with 1,663 cases in January 2010 climbs to peaks (e.g., 7,897 in December 2018). Periodic decreases, such as in January of various years, hint at possible reporting delays or seasonal influences. The most recent months show continued concern with cases consistently above 5,000, hitting 5,664 in November 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the same timeframe, AIDS-related deaths have also increased, paralleling the rise in cases. Initial death counts, like 301 in January 2010, ascend over time, reaching 2,484 in December 2019 as the highest report. Interestingly, mortality spikes are often, but not always, aligned with the highest case reports; for example, cases peak in December 2018, but deaths peak later in 2019. Most recent data uphold this trend, with November 2023 reporting 1,955 deaths. Notably, from 2010 to 2023, February shows contrasting lower cases but not correspondingly lower deaths, potentially indicative of reporting variances or seasonal effects.

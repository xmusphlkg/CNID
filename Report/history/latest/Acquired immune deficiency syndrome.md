## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). By damaging the immune system, HIV interferes with the body's ability to fight off infectious diseases and cancer. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. The virus can be transmitted through blood, semen, vaginal and rectal fluids, and breast milk. There are effective treatments that can significantly slow the disease's progress, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of transmission to others. Without treatment, those with AIDS typically survive about three years.

## Highlights

- A gradual increase in reported AIDS cases and deaths from 2010 to 2023, indicating a growing epidemic in mainland China. <br/>
- Particularly high peaks in cases and deaths are observed towards the end of each year, which could suggest seasonality or reporting practices. <br/>
- The data for January 2013 and February 2013 are missing, which may impact the accuracy of trend analysis for that period. <br/>
- The cases in October 2023 are elevated (5210 cases), with a substantial number of deaths (1866), reflecting a continued need for enhanced public health interventions. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, Mainland China experienced fluctuations in monthly AIDS cases. Initial increases peaked in December 2010 (3,980), then showed variable patterns with subsequent highs in December of 2017 (6,622) and December 2018 (7,897). A notable decline occurred in March 2013, with missing data, then cases surged, reaching the preeminent peak in December 2021 (7,490). Cases diminished notably in January 2023 (1,815) then rose again in subsequent months, indicating a potential resurgence or reporting anomalies.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths from AIDS followed an upward trend from 301 in January 2010 to a staggering 2,484 in December 2019, reflecting increased mortality despite improved treatments globally. A substantial decrease is observed in 2020, potentially due to reporting changes or healthcare interventions. However, deaths rose again, hitting the highest number in December 2021 (2,486). Interestingly, January 2023 showed a disproportionate increase in deaths (1,777) compared to cases, which could suggest reporting delays, changes in death attribution, or data quality issues. Subsequent months show continued high death rates, necessitating further investigation into potential causes and public health responses.

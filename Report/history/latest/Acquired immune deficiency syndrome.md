## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Contracted primarily through unprotected sexual intercourse or intravenous drug use, HIV attacks the immune system, impairing its ability to fight disease and infection. Over time, as the immune system weakens, the body becomes increasingly vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers, marking the transition from HIV to AIDS. There is no cure, but antiretroviral therapy can prolong lifespan and improve quality of life.
## Highlights

- An upward trend in AIDS cases and deaths between 2010 and 2023 in China indicates a growing healthcare challenge. <br/>
- A peak in disease occurrence was recorded in December 2021, with 7,490 cases and 2,486 deaths, highlighting a critical time for intervention. <br/>
- In January 2023, a sharp decline in cases was reported; however, deaths increased dramatically, suggesting late diagnoses or treatment shortfalls. <br/>
- Recent data from November 2023 show a resurgence to 5,664 cases and 1,955 deaths, emphasizing the persistent threat of AIDS and the need for sustained control measures. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from 2010 to 2023 for AIDS in mainland China shows fluctuations with a significant increase over time. The early phase (2010-2013) presented a gradual rise in cases. A notable spike occurs in July 2010, with 5930 cases, but it's by 2018 that the highest number, 7897 cases in December, reflects a stark progression. Since 2018, cases generally trend upwards, oscillating between mid-4000s to high-7000s monthly, indicating either increased transmission, reporting, or both. The latest year shows a mix of dips and peaks without a clear tapering, suggesting sustained transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths associated with AIDS in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 also display an increasing trend. The numbers stayed below 1000 per month until a surge in June 2010. They gradually increased, reaching over 2000 monthly deaths by 2018, with December of 2018 and 2021 recording exceedingly high numbers, 2444 and 2486 respectively. The last five years especially have been marked by death counts frequently surpassing 1500 per month, indicating the ongoing severity and challenge in managing late-stage complications. The consistent monthly death toll over a thousand in recent years underscores the persistent impact of AIDS on public health.

## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging immune system, HIV interferes with the body's ability to fight infection and disease. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection, and not everyone who has HIV advances to this stage. Many people with HIV can live for many years and enjoy a good quality of life with proper, ongoing treatment and medical and emotional care.
## Highlights

- A consistent increase in cases of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is evident from 2010 to 2023, indicating a persistent spread of HIV in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
- There is an upward trend in the number of deaths associated with AIDS, with noticeable spikes in December of each year, suggesting a seasonal pattern in mortality rates. <br/>
- The data for January 2013 is missing, which might indicate a reporting issue or a potential data collection problem during that period. <br/>
- Recent data from 2023 indicates a slight stabilization in the number of cases and deaths each month compared to the highs seen in previous years; however, the disease continues to represent a significant health challenge with nearly 2000 deaths in November 2023.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, the reported cases of Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Chinese mainland show seasonal fluctuations and a general increasing trend year-over-year. For instance, a peak can be observed in the later months of each year, especially around November and December, with cases reaching as high as 7897 in December 2018. However, the start of 2020 and the years that followed show a noticeable rise in cases compared to previous years, indicating a potentially escalating epidemic situation or improved case detection methodologies and reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll associated with AIDS in the Chinese mainland also reveals an upward trend alongside the reported cases, with notable spikes observed in the data. High mortality numbers are consistently recorded towards the end of each year, peaking in December. For example, December 2017 and 2019 witnessed significant increases in deaths, with 1834 and 2284 fatalities, respectively. The peak in fatalities in 2021 with 2486 deaths in December suggests that while case numbers are growing, efforts to reduce mortality may not be proportionally effective, or there might be a lag in the implementation of effective treatments.

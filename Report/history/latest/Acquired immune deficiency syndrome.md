## Introduction

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV damages the immune system, impeding the body's ability to fight off organisms that cause disease. It's transmitted through contact with certain body fluids of a person infected with HIV, predominantly via unprotected sex, sharing drug injections, or from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding. AIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection, characterized by a severely damaged immune system leading to opportunistic infections or cancers.
## Highlights

- A persistent increase in both reported AIDS cases and deaths from 2010 to 2023, with cases peaking in December 2018 at 7897 and deaths peaking in December 2021 at 2486. <br/>
- Despite some fluctuations, there is a notable upward trend in the number of deaths associated with AIDS, suggesting either increased virulence, late diagnosis, or challenges in treatment and management. <br/>
- The highest numbers of reported deaths in recent years consistently occurred in the latter half of the year, indicating potential seasonal patterns or reporting artifacts that warrant further investigation. <br/>
- The data for January 2023 shows a notable decrease in cases to 1815 but an increased number of deaths at 1777, suggesting a possible improvement in detection or a severe spike in mortality requiring urgent attention. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The incidence of AIDS in Mainland China from January 2010 to November 2023 demonstrates an overall increasing trend in reported cases. Initial figures in 2010 started moderately and increased significantly throughout the year, peaking at 3980 cases in December. Each subsequent year saw recurrent surges, typically reaching their apex towards the year-end. December 2018 recorded the highest number of cases at 7897. After a relatively lower count in early 2020, presumably influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on healthcare services, numbers surged again, indicating that the epidemic's overarching trajectory remains a major public health concern.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the same period, the number of AIDS-related deaths showed a concerning upward trend, with periodic fluctuations. Initial deaths in 2010 were relatively lower, but by December 2012, deaths had exceeded 1000 monthly, and the upward trajectory became more pronounced. December of 2017 and 2018 marked the highest annual fatality peaks, with 1834 and 2444 deaths, respectively. A slight dip in early 2020 coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting possible disruptions in healthcare access or reporting. However, this drop was followed by the highest number of deaths recorded in December 2020 at 2105, emphasizing the persistent lethality of the disease despite ongoing interventions.

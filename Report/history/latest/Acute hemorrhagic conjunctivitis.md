Seasonal Patterns: The data provided suggests a clear seasonal pattern for Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) in mainland China, with a peak in cases during the summer months and a decrease during the winter months. This can be observed from the higher number of cases reported in June, July, and August, and the lower number of cases reported in December, January, and February.

Peak and Trough Periods: AHC in mainland China reaches its peak during the summer months, specifically in June, July, and August. These months consistently show a higher number of cases compared to other months. Conversely, the number of cases is comparatively lower during the winter months, particularly in December, January, and February.

Overall Trends: Examining the overall trends, there is a noticeable increase in the number of AHC cases reported in mainland China from 2010 to 2015. The number of cases then exhibits some fluctuations from 2015 to 2020 but remains relatively stable. It is worth noting that a sudden surge in cases occurred in June and July of 2023, with a significant spike in the number of cases reported in July.

Discussion: The seasonal pattern of AHC in mainland China suggests a higher risk of transmission during the summer months, which aligns with the known mode of transmission of this disease through close contact and poor hygiene practices. These patterns may be influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, population movement, and changes in disease prevalence. The sudden surge in cases in 2023 necessitates further investigation to identify the underlying causes and potential risk factors associated with this increase. Continuous monitoring and surveillance of AHC cases are necessary to comprehend the ongoing trends and implement appropriate control measures to prevent further disease transmission.

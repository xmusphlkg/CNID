Thank you for providing the data. Let's begin by analyzing the monthly cases of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in mainland China from January 2010 to June 2023.

To identify seasonal patterns, we can start by visualizing the data. Here is a plot showing the trends in monthly cases:

From the plot, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Seasonality: There is a clear seasonal pattern in the data, with regular peaks and troughs occurring each year. The number of cases tends to increase during certain months and decrease during others.

2. Peaks and Troughs: The highest peaks in the number of cases occur in the months of July and August, followed by a gradual decline in the subsequent months. The lowest points or troughs are usually observed in January and February.

3. Overall Trends: Over the years, there seems to be an overall increasing trend in the number of cases. Although there are fluctuations, the general trend shows an upward trajectory.

It's important to note that the data for deaths is limited, with most months reporting zero deaths. Therefore, it may not provide significant insights into the mortality pattern of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis.

Next, let's quantify these patterns by calculating the average number of cases for each month and examining the annual trends.

Here is the average number of cases for each month:

| Month     | Average Cases |
|:----------|--------------:|
| January   |        1908.3 |
| February  |        1759.9 |
| March     |        2490.3 |
| April     |        2817.4 |
| May       |        3232.4 |
| June      |        3608.1 |
| July      |        3676.9 |
| August    |        3377.1 |
| September |        3303.5 |
| October   |        2700.9 |
| November  |        2505.9 |
| December  |        2397.5 |

By examining the annual trends, we can observe the following:

1. Higher number of cases tend to occur during the summer months (June to August) and early autumn (September). These months consistently have higher averages compared to other months.

2. The lowest number of cases are typically observed in winter and early spring (January to March). January and February consistently have the lowest averages.

3. There is some variation in the number of cases during the autumn and spring months, with October and November showing relatively lower averages compared to the surrounding months.

Overall, this analysis suggests that Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis exhibits strong seasonality in mainland China, with peak periods occurring in the summer months. There is also an increasing trend in the number of cases over the years, although with some fluctuations.

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided data. Additional data and further analysis might be necessary to draw more accurate conclusions and explore potential factors contributing to these patterns.

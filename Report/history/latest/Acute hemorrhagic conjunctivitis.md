## Introduction

Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious, rapidly spreading viral infection that affects the conjunctiva of the eye. The disease is characterized by conjunctival redness, swelling, and a sudden onset of pain. Clinical manifestations often include hemorrhage and secretion of a thin-watery substance. It is generally caused by two types of enteroviruses - Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24 variant. This condition quickly spreads in crowded places and has been responsible for numerous epidemics worldwide. It is self-limited and resolves without treatment within one to two weeks.

## Highlights

- An extraordinary spike in acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases occurred in September 2023 with 125,264 reported cases, a stark contrast to historical monthly observations. <br/>
- Despite the surge, no deaths were reported in November 2023, suggesting a non-fatal course of the outbreak. <br/>
- Case numbers sharply increased from June 2023 onwards, indicative of a potential outbreak or rapid spread during the mid-year period. <br/>
- Mortality has remained very low, with the exception of a slight increase in February 2020, underscoring the generally non-lethal nature of the disease. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) in China mainland from November 2013 to November 2023 indicate an endemic presence with considerable fluctuations. The average monthly cases steadily increased over the years, peaking in September 2023 with 125,264 cases, an unusual surge. Seasonal variability is evident, with cases typically increasing during summer months (June to August), which is consistent with patterns of enterovirus transmission, a common cause of AHC. The abrupt spike in 2023 warrants investigation for potential outbreak causes, such as novel viral strains or super-spreading events.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the decade of surveillance data, there have only been three reported deaths associated with AHC, all occurring in the winter months of 2019 and 2020. The exceptionally low mortality rate indicates that while AHC may be highly contagious, it is typically non-fatal. The isolated deaths in 2020 may suggest possible complications or concurrent health issues in those cases. The zero-death count, despite the drastic increase in cases in 2023, reinforces the notion that AHC, while capable of widespread transmission, poses minimal lethal threat. This could reflect the self-limiting nature of the disease or effective case management and treatment protocols.

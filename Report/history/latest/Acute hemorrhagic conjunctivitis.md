## Introduction

Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious eye infection characterized by sudden onset of painful, swollen red eyes, followed by subconjunctival hemorrhages, tearing, photophobia, and blurred vision. It typically affects the conjunctiva, the clear membrane covering the white part of the eye and the inner eyelids. AHC is primarily caused by the enterovirus 70 and the coxsackievirus A24, and occasionally by adenoviruses. It spreads easily through direct contact with contaminated hands, objects, or ophthalmologic instruments. Outbreaks often occur in crowded settings, usually as epidemics with a significant public health impact.

## Highlights

- There is a cyclical trend observed in Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases with a surge noticed around the months of August to October. The peak, in 2023, is observed in September with 125264 cases. <br/>
- Despite a high number of reported cases, mortality rate remains extremely low, almost negligible, with only three reported deaths in the last decade. <br/>
- Over the latest decade, the number of cases seems to gradually decrease until 2023 when a significant upsurge is reported. This suggests a potential outbreak or variation in the viral strain. <br/>
- The drastic increase in cases from June 2023, peaking in September 2023, indicates the current situation to be critical and necessitates rigorous epidemiological surveillance.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reflects an annual cycle of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases in mainland China, with the incidence generally rising in the spring, peaking in the summer, and declining in the fall and winter. This seasonal trend aligns with the known epidemiology of the disease. There are exceptional spikes seen in September 2010 and 2023, potentially indicating major outbreak events. Overall, an increase in the number of cases over the longer term can also be observed, suggesting a growing disease burden. The highest spike occurs in September 2023 with 125264 cases.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of reported deaths due to Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in mainland China is remarkably low, with only three recorded deaths over the presented timeframe. These occurred in December 2011, August 2019, and February 2020. The low fatality rate reflects the typically self-limiting nature of the disease, which generally only poses a significant risk to health in rare events of severe conditions or complications arising.

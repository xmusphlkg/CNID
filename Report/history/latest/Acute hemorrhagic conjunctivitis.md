## Introduction

Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious, viral infection of the eye. Notorious for causing outbreaks worldwide, it is often linked to Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24 variant. Typically short-lived, AHC manifests with symptoms like sudden onset of eye pain, swelling, redness, and a drastic increase in tear production. In some cases, it can lead to subconjunctival hemorrhage. Although usually self-limiting, it causes significant discomfort and has implications for public health due to its rapid spread.

## Highlights

1. Significant peak in cases: The data shows a substantial peak in Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) cases in September 2023, with 125,264 reported cases which is an anomaly compared to previous data.<br/>
2. Seasonal trend: Historically, there's a marked increase in AHC cases during the summer months (from June) and peaks around September, followed by a decrease, which continues through the colder months.<br/>
3. Low Mortality: Despite the high number of cases, the fatality rate is very low. There are only 3 recorded deaths from 2010 to 2023.<br/>
4. Overall decrease in cases until the recent increase: Observably, the annual number of AHC cases were in a declining trend from 2010 to 2022, but there's a sudden increase in 2023, which needs further investigation.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis exhibited a seasonal increase from July to October with significant spikes happening on September 2010 and September 2023. The data shows overall upward trends over the years, punctuated by occasional dip in cases mid-year. There are also prominent jumps in September 2010 and September 2023, where the cases surged to 48658 and 125264 respectively - possibly indicative of an outbreak. Apart from these, variations in monthly cases follow a somewhat consistent sinusoidal pattern, with the peaks typically occurring from July to October each year.

### Deaths Analysis
Regarding fatalities, the lethality rate for Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is remarkably low, with only three recorded deaths within the 13 years span. The recorded deaths occurred in December 2011, August 2019, and February 2020, each with a singular death per month, indicating sporadic fatalities unrelated to the number of cases. Generally, this suggests an effective symptom management and healthcare system addressing the disease's severity. However, as minor variations may not be accounted for in data, future health status or co-morbidity in individuals are potential risk factors that need deeper exploration.

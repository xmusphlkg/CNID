## Introduction

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is an extremely contagious disease primarily affecting the eyes. First recognized in 1969, it is characterized by sudden onset of painful, swollen, red eyes with bloody discharges. The disease is typically caused by either the Enterovirus 70 or Coxsackievirus A24, both non-polio enteroviruses. Despite its alarming presentation, AHC usually resolves without treatment within seven to ten days. However, it can spread rapidly, causing significant outbreaks, and therefore requires careful surveillance and prompt case notification.
## Highlights

- Seasonal peaks of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in China mainland are typically around August-September, with the highest peak of 125,264 cases in September 2023. <br/>
- Instance of deaths is extremely rare despite the high incidence rate; only three deaths are noted over 13 years, highlighting the non-fatal nature of AHC. <br/>
- A significant yearly increase in cases begins in 2018, indicating a possible change in disease dynamics or reporting practices. <br/>
- September 2023 marked an unprecedented surge, significantly above the annual trends, warranting investigation into potential outbreak causes. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data portrays a cyclical pattern of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) infections with peaks generally occurring in late summer and early autumn, which may suggest a seasonal influence on transmission. The data for September 2023 exhibits an anomaly, with a stark spike of 125,264 cases, deviating significantly from the usual pattern, indicating a possible outbreak or improved reporting mechanisms. However, a gradual increase in cases began in June 2023, denoting a concerning upward trend relative to seasonal norms. Strategies for outbreak control and disease prevention should focus on these critical periods.

### Deaths Analysis
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is largely a self-limiting infection with low mortality, as illustrated by the zero-death count throughout the majority of the reporting period. Notably, there is a minor increase in deaths in February 2020 (2 deaths) and a single death reported in both August 2011 and August 2019. This data suggests that while AHC is highly transmissible, it has a very low case fatality rate. The small number of deaths could indicate rare complications or perhaps misclassifications, illustrating a need for careful clinical and epidemiological assessment of AHC-related fatalities.

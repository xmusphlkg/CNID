## Introduction

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious, viral infection of the conjunctiva characterized by sudden onset of painful, swollen, red eyes, with subconjunctival hemorrhages, and excessive tearing. The condition may also involve blurry vision, sensitivity to light, and the sensation of a foreign body in the eye. Enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24 variant are the primary causative agents. It can affect individuals of all ages and spreads rapidly through direct contact with ocular secretions or contaminated surfaces. Outbreaks are more common in tropical and subtropical regions. There is no specific treatment; management focuses on symptomatic relief.

## Highlights

- A dramatic spike in acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases occurred in September 2023, with 125,264 reported cases, representing a stark increase from previous months and the highest monthly case count in the dataset. <br/>
- Despite the significant rise in cases, there have been no reported deaths associated with the disease in October 2023, continuing a trend of low mortality throughout the observed period. <br/>
- The cases in October 2023 show a decrease to 23,111, suggesting that the peak of the outbreak may have passed or that control measures are taking effect. <br/>
- Historical data indicate that the disease exhibits seasonality with peaks during the summer months, but the surge in 2023 surpasses seasonal trends and warrants investigations into potential new viral strains or changes in transmission patterns. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between January 2010 and October 2023, mainland China reported an increasing trend in acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases with seasonal peaks, particularly during late summer and early autumn. The most notable surge occurred in September 2023, with a record 125,264 cases, indicating a significant outbreak. The data shows sporadic fluctuations, but the overall trajectory suggests heightened transmission during warmer months. Prior to the 2023 escalation, there were occasional spikes, including significant increases in September of 2010 and 2014.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the thirteen-year span, deaths remained exceptionally rare, with only three fatalities reported among tens of thousands of cases, emphasizing the typically non-lethal nature of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. The mortalities were recorded in December 2011, August 2019, and February 2020. Despite the substantial outbreak in case numbers observed in 2023, no deaths were reported. This pattern reflects the disease's relatively low mortality risk despite its capacity for rapid and extensive spread within a population.

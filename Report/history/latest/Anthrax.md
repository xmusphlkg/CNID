## Introduction

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It primarily affects livestock and wild game, but can also infect humans when they are exposed to the bacteria through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products, inhalation of spores, or ingestion. In humans, anthrax presents in various forms: cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal, and injectional, each with different symptoms. This disease is not contagious person-to-person. Effective vaccines and antibiotics are available for treatment and prevention. If left untreated, anthrax can be fatal.

## Highlights

- Seasonal spikes during the warmer months: Notably, cases seem to peak annually during the summer months, especially from July to August, suggesting a seasonal pattern possibly related to climatic conditions and human activities. <br/>
- Moderate increase in cases over the years: Although fluctuations are present, there is a general trend of increasing anthrax cases, with a significant jump observed in August 2023 (123 cases), indicating a need for preventive measures. <br/>
- Low mortality rate: The data reflects a relatively low mortality rate across the years, with few deaths reported even when case numbers are high, which could be attributed to effective medical interventions. <br/>
- The current disease situation as of October 2023: With 47 cases and no deaths reported, the situation seems to be under control, but continuous surveillance and preventive strategies are imperative to avert spikes like that seen in August. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The anthrax case data from mainland China between January 2010 and October 2023 shows seasonal variation with a higher incidence in the summer months, especially from June to August. The year 2018 had the highest reported cases with 103 in August, suggesting possible outbreaks. Over the years, there is a slight increasing trend in case numbers, indicating either improved surveillance and reporting, or environmental factors contributing to more frequent transmission from animal to human hosts, pointing to potential occupational or agricultural exposure risks that require ongoing monitoring and intervention.

### Deaths Analysis
The death count from anthrax from 2010 to 2023 indicates low fatality rates with 0 to 4 deaths reported per occurrence, the higher mortality observed in September 2012. Despite an upward trend in cases in some years, deaths have remained relatively stable. This stability suggests effective clinical interventions and timely treatment for infected individuals. Seasonal spikes in mortality align with higher case reports, underscoring the importance of heightened vigilance and rapid response during peak transmission periods. Continued efforts in prevention, early detection, and treatment are essential to maintain or reduce these mortality rates.

## Introduction

Brucellosis is a bacterial infection acquired through contact with animals or animal products contaminated with the Brucella bacteria. Humans can contract the disease by consuming untreated milk or undercooked meat, or through direct contact with infected animals. Symptoms range from fever, fatigue, and sweating, to more serious complications affecting the heart or central nervous system. It's largely found in rural, agricultural regions. Treatment typically involves prolonged antibiotic therapy.

## Highlights

1. There has been a notable increase in brucellosis cases over the observed period, with particularly high incidence in the warm months (May to August). <br/>
2. Despite fluctuations, the number of reported cases in recent years, especially from 2016 onward, shows a noticeably upward trend, suggesting worsening circumstances. <br/>
3. The mortality rate due to brucellosis remains low, with only sporadic cases of death reported annually. However, the recent occurrences of fatalities in September 2023 indicates a potentially concerning development. <br/>
4. As of November 2023, the disease situation remains high with 4540 cases reported, indicating ongoing transmission and need for brucellosis control measures.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The reported dataset for Brucellosis in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 indicates seasonal cyclic trends, with cases peaking during the spring and summer months, reflecting the zoonotic nature of the disease. From 2010, there has been an overall increasing trend in Brucellosis cases, culminating in 2022's peak of 9943 in June. Thereafter, reported cases declined sharply, reaching a low of 1820 in December 2022. Despite this, the numbers have shown a steady rebound during the early months of 2023.

### Deaths Analysis

Despite the increasing number of cases over the 14-year period, Brucellosis-related death rates remained relatively low. The data suggests sporadic fatalities, usually not exceeding 1-2 deaths per month. However, there is a noticeable increase in fatalities in recent years, particularly in months with higher case numbers such as July 2023, indicating a possible parallel but not directly proportional relationship between the number of cases and deaths.

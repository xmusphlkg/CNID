## Introduction

Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacterial genus Brucella, which is transmitted from animals to humans. It commonly affects cattle, swine, goats, sheep, and dogs. Humans typically acquire the disease through direct contact with infected animals or by consuming contaminated animal products, especially unpasteurized milk and cheese. Characterized by fever, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint swelling, brucellosis can become chronic and may affect various organs. The infection is diagnosed through blood tests and is treated with prolonged courses of antibiotics.ñ €¼br>

## Highlights

- Steady increase in case numbers over the years, with a notable peak in the summer months, suggesting a possible seasonal pattern. <br/>
- Mortality remains low, with occasional single death occurrences, indicating that Brucellosis, while spreading, is not generally causing high mortality. <br/>
- The spike in cases in early 2020 might be attributed to reduced reporting during the initial COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a catch-up in reporting as systems normalized. <br/>
- The highest recorded number of cases in a single month was in June 2021 (9670 cases), highlighting a significant outbreak or improved reporting mechanisms. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data exhibits a clear seasonal trend in Brucellosis cases in mainland China, with cases generally peaking in the summer months from May to August. Over the years, there is also an apparent increasing trend in the number of cases, peaking in 2022. The highest number of cases within a single month was reported in June 2022 (9943 cases). In contrast, the winter months, particularly from November to February, tend to have the fewest reported cases, which can be partially attributed to seasonal occupational patterns and the lifecycle of the Brucella bacteria.

### Deaths Analysis
Brucellosis maintains a notably low mortality rate, with many months reporting zero deaths despite the high number of cases. The overall death count across the data set is minimal, totaling 21 fatalities from 2010 to 2023. Occasional spikes in mortality are observed, such as in July 2023 with a single death reported and September 2023 with two deaths. The low lethality of the disease underscores the effective management and treatment options available, although increases in case numbers do call for continued surveillance and control measures.

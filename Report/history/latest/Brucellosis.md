## Introduction

Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by Brucella species primarily spreading from animals to humans. The transmission generally occurs through consuming infected, unpasteurized animal products or direct contact with infected animals. Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, fatigue, and may involve multiple organ systems, leading to complications. Since it has significant public health implications and can cause economic loss in livestock industries, it is regarded as an important occupational disease amongst farmers, veterinarians, and slaughterhouse workers. Comprehensive prevention strategies, via vaccination and public education, are crucial to controlling its prevalence.
## Highlights

- Consistent seasonal pattern observed with cases peaking during summer months—May through July—with the highest number of cases recorded in July across most years.<br/>
- The overall trend shows a relatively steady increase in cases over the years, with an ascending trajectory from 2010 to 2023, suggesting an upswing in transmission or reporting of brucellosis.<br/>
- Mortality associated with brucellosis remains very low, with sparse deaths reported sporadically over the years. This pattern highlights the non-fatal nature of the disease when managed appropriately.<br/>
- The recent data from 2023 indicates a slight decline in cases compared to the previous year, although still high, with November reporting 4540 cases and no deaths. There may be a need for continued monitoring and intervention to address the persistent disease occurrence.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the span from January 2010 to November 2023, Brucellosis cases in Chinese mainland show clear seasonality, with peaks typically occurring in the warmer months, May through October, potentially due to increased agricultural activity and livestock contact. Cases gradually increased from 2010, with variability in monthly counts, peaking in July 2023 with 9164 cases. Despite annual fluctuations, a general upward trend can be observed, indicating a need for better control measures and heightened awareness, particularly with the highest ever numbers towards the latest data points.

### Deaths Analysis
Brucellosis-related deaths are rare, totaling 15 from 2010 to November 2023. Notable is the zero-death count for numerous consecutive months, despite fluctuating case numbers. The few occurrences of fatalities often do not correspond to peak case counts, suggesting effective clinical management for most cases. However, the scattered pattern of deaths over the years, including a record of 2 in September 2023, underscores the need for continued vigilance and improvement in both preventive and treatment protocols.

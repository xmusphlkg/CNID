## Introduction

Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella, typically transmitted from animals to humans, primarily through the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, direct contact with infected animals, or inhalation of airborne agents. It is characterized by fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, and muscle pain, and can result in more chronic symptoms including arthritis and spondylitis. Though it can affect any organ system, it predominantly targets the musculoskeletal system. Various mammalian species act as reservoirs for Brucella, including cattle, goats, camels, and swine. Prevention strategies revolve around animal vaccination, food safety measures, and occupational precautions.

## Highlights

- Despite the volatile monthly reported cases of Brucellosis from 2010 to 2023, there is a general increasing trend in the number of cases. The highest peak was in June 2022 with approximately 9943 reported cases.<br/>
- There is a clear yearly cyclical pattern noticeable, wherein reported cases tend to rise during spring and summer months (from March to August), followed by a decrease in autumn and winter (from September to February).<br/>
- While the number of reported Brucellosis cases remains high, the reported deaths are very low in comparison. This suggests that while the infection rate may be increasing, the disease is not necessarily causing a proportionate number of deaths.<br/>
- As of September 2023, there are 5987 reported cases and 2 reported deaths, indicating the ongoing public health situation in mainland China.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Brucellosis cases from 2010 to 2023 demonstrate significant seasonality in mainland China. The numbers start to rise in March, peaking between May to July, then gradually declining through August into the end of the year. Notably, the number of total cases trend upward over the years, suggesting that control measures may be falling short. The year 2023 shows the highest peak with 9164 cases in July. There's a decrease in cases at the beginning of the year, which could be due to reduced transmission during colder months.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the increasing trend in cases, Brucellosis fatalities remain sporadically low, generally ranging from 0 to 2 deaths throughout the reporting period. This suggests a less virulent strain or effective treatment protocols once diagnosed. However, the presence of isolated fatalities, such as two deaths in September 2023, indicates the potential severity of the disease. It's also important to stress that while the mortality rate is low, the morbidity impact of Brucellosis, leading to diminished quality of life, should not be underestimated.

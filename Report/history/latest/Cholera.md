## Introduction

Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It primarily spreads through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Symptoms include severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Without prompt treatment, these symptoms can be life-threatening due to rapid fluid loss. Infection is most common in places with inadequate water treatment, poor sanitation, and hygiene practices. Preventative measures include improved sanitation, safe drinking water, and vaccines. Treatment consists of rehydration, using oral rehydration salts or intravenous fluids, and antibiotics in severe cases.

## Highlights

- Seasonal pattern observed with case spikes typically occurring from July to September, coinciding with the warm and rainy season conducive to cholera transmission. <br/>
- A notable steady presence of cases each year with no significant uptrend or downtrend over the period analyzed, reflecting an endemic situation. <br/>
- Zero fatality rates in most months suggest either a low virulence strain of Vibrio cholerae, effective treatment modalities, or underreporting of cholera-attributable deaths. <br/>
- As of October 2023, the situation remains stable with a low number of cholera cases (2) and no deaths, indicating ongoing control measures may be effective. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Cholera case distribution in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 indicates sporadic activity, with the absence of cases for extended periods and spikes often occurring in the summer months. The year 2010 was marked by a notable increase in August (63 cases), while other years generally observed far fewer cases. July and August seem to be high-risk months, aligning with factors favorable for Vibrio cholerae. Despite fluctuations, there is no discernible escalating trend in cholera cases over the observed years, and instances remain relatively low.

### Deaths Analysis
Death data signify an extremely low fatality rate for cholera in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. Only 2 deaths were recorded, both in 2013, amidst a relatively low count of cases. This could illustrate the effectiveness of China's health system in cholera management and treatment responsiveness. The infrequency of deaths associated with cholera cases over the years supports the success of public health measures, including water sanitation, healthcare access, and possibly cholera vaccination efforts among at-risk populations.

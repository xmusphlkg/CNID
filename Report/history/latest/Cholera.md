## Introduction

Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It mainly affects the intestines and is typically transmitted through contaminated water or food. Common symptoms include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Worldwide, it impacts 3-5 million people and causes 28,000-142,000 deaths a year. While readily treatable, without swift medical intervention, it can be fatal. Prevention largely depends on access to safe water and sanitation systems, along with vaccines in areas where the disease is endemic.
## Highlights

- Cholera in Chinese mainland exhibits seasonal patterns with peaks during warmer months, suggesting a climate influence on transmission. <br/>
- Despite periodic spikes, such as 12 cases in August 2018, no deaths were recorded from 2013 to 2023, indicating effective management and potential low virulence. <br/>
- The trend of consistent, sporadic annual occurrences signifies persistent low-level risk, underscoring the need for ongoing public health monitoring and intervention. <br/>
- Zero cases reported in November 2023 reflect successful current control measures or possible underreporting, necessitating continuous surveillance. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From November 2013 to November 2023, reported cholera cases in Chinese mainland were sporadic, with no cases reported in numerous months. The dataset indicates a seasonal pattern, with small outbreaks typically occurring during the warmer months, July through October. An annual decline in cases is not apparent, suggesting a consistent low-endemic presence. Notably, peak case numbers gradually increase from 2013 to a high of 12 cases in August 2018 and 12 cases in August 2019, before slightly dropping again. Most months have zero cases reported, signifying either effective containment measures or underreporting.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the ten-year span, there were zero deaths reported from cholera in Chinese mainland, according to the presented data. This demonstrates a remarkably high survival rate among those infected. This could be attributed to effective clinical treatment and prompt medical response, availability of rehydration therapies, vaccination campaigns, or public health interventions. It may also reflect a strong disease surveillance and response system capable of controlling outbreaks efficiently. No mortality trend can be derived as no deaths have been reported.

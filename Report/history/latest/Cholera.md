Seasonal Patterns: 
From the data provided, there is a clear seasonal pattern in the number of Cholera cases in mainland China. The number of cases tends to be low during the winter months (January, February, and December), with no reported cases during these months in most years. The number of cases starts to increase in the spring months (March, April, and May), with a peak usually reached in the summer months (June, July, and August), and then declines in the fall months (September, October, and November).

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for Cholera cases in mainland China is consistently observed during the summer months, particularly in June, July, and August. These months consistently have the highest number of reported cases. On the other hand, the trough period, with the lowest number of reported cases, is typically observed during the winter months, especially in January and February.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there is a noticeable decrease in the number of Cholera cases over the years. The highest number of cases was reported in 2010, with 63 cases in August, followed by a gradual decrease in the subsequent years. The number of cases remained relatively low in the later years, with occasional peaks but generally lower than the peak in 2010.

Discussion:
The seasonal patterns of Cholera cases in mainland China indicate a clear association with temperature and climate. The increase in cases during the summer months is likely due to factors such as increased travel, higher temperatures, and a greater likelihood of water contamination. On the other hand, the lower number of cases during the winter months could be attributed to decreased travel, lower temperatures, and improved sanitation practices.

The observed decrease in overall Cholera cases over the years suggests that efforts in public health interventions and improved sanitation practices may have had a positive impact in reducing the transmission and occurrence of Cholera in mainland China.

It is important to note that the data provided only includes cases and deaths before June 2023, and additional data beyond this period would be necessary to further analyze and draw more conclusive trends and patterns.

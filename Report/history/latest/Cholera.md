## Introduction

Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It can occur in outbreaks and is most common in places with poor sanitation, crowded conditions, and lack of access to clean water. Transmission occurs primarily through consumption of contaminated water or food. Often mild or without symptoms, severe cases show rapid onset of profuse, watery diarrhea which can lead to severe dehydration and death if untreated. Prevention involves improved sanitation, safe drinking water, and vaccines.

## Highlights

1. Seasonal increase: The data demonstrates a general trend of an increase in cholera cases during the summer months, particularly in August. <br/>
2. Annual decline: While few peaks are evident (such as in August 2010 and August 2018), overall, the reported cases have shown an overall slow decline from 2010 to 2023. <br/>
3. Low fatality rate: The fatality rate is extremely low. Only two deaths were reported in 2013, while all other instances reported no fatalities. <br/>
4. No new cases in winters: Particularly between November to April, almost no new cases are reported, signifying a seasonal impact on disease incidence. <br/>


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows a variable but generally low number of reported cholera cases in mainland China from 2010-2023. The trend appears seasonal, with case numbers often peaking during the summer months and dropping to zero during winter. Case numbers peaked noticeably in August 2010 with 63 cases. Although fluctuations are observed over the years, no consistent increase or decrease pattern is noticeable. It is crucial to assess these patterns in relation to changes in surveillance, diagnostic capacities, and healthcare access, which could influence the number of reported cases.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality related to cholera in mainland China over this period is minimal, with only two recorded deaths in July and September of 2013. This suggests that the cholera disease burden is low, possibly due to efficient disease control measures, medical treatment, or underreporting of deaths. The low mortality rate could also indicate cholera typically manifesting in a less severe form in this population, though further data would be needed for such assertions. Despite the low mortality, continuous monitoring and prevention efforts remain essential, given cholera's potential for rapid spread and severe impact.

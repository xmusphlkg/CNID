## Introduction

Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Characterized by severe diarrhea and dehydration, cholera is transmitted through contaminated water or food. The condition primarily affects regions with poor sanitation, crowding, conflict, and famine. Most infected individuals display mild symptoms, but in severe cases, rapid loss of body fluids can lead to dehydration and shock, potentially resulting in death. Rapid diagnosis and treatment with rehydration and antibiotics are essential to prevent fatalities. Vaccinations are also available, serving as important preventive measures.
## Highlights

- Seasonal trends indicate that cholera cases in the Chinese mainland peak during the summer months (May to August), consistent with increased bacterial growth and transmission in warmer temperatures. <br/>
- The overall case fatality ratio appears to be very low with deaths rarely occurring, reflecting either mild disease manifestation or effective management of cases. <br/>
- There has been no spike in cases or deaths suggestive of an outbreak situation in recent months; the disease incidence has remained relatively stable over the years, suggesting effective surveillance and control measures. <br/>
- As of November 2023, there have been zero reported cases and deaths, maintaining the trend of no cases observed in November across multiple years, which may indicate successful preemptive interventions ahead of the typical low-transmission season.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The cholera case data from the Chinese mainland over the years 2010 to 2023 show seasonal variability with a noticeable peak in the warmer months, particularly from July to September. This pattern aligns with cholera's association with warmer temperatures, which can affect the proliferation of Vibrio cholerae in water sources. The majority of years follow this trend with occasional outbreaks, the largest being in August 2010 with 63 cases. Annual fluctuations are evident, with some years witnessing minor surges. Notably, there were no reported cases in several winter and early spring months, emphasizing the seasonal nature of transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the observed period, the cholera death toll in the Chinese mainland has been exceptionally low, with only two reported deaths out of the cumulative number of cases, indicating an effective healthcare response in treating and managing cholera infections. Both deaths occurred in 2013, a year with otherwise similar case numbers to preceding and following years. The absence of deaths subsequently suggests either improvements in public health interventions, increased awareness and prompt treatment, or the circulation of less virulent strains of V. cholerae. The consistent low mortality could also reflect a well-established surveillance system capable of handling sporadic cases efficiently.

## Introduction

Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Spread through respiratory droplets, it primarily affects the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, creating a thick, gray covering in the throat, leading to difficulty breathing, swallowing, and potentially blocking the airways. Other symptoms include fever, sore throat, and weakness. It can also produce a potent toxin affecting other organs. Vaccination with the diphtheria toxoid is highly effective for prevention, which is included in the routine childhood vaccine schedule. Untreated diphtheria can be fatal, particularly in children.

## Highlights

- Incidence of Diphtheria in mainland China is extremely low with zero to one reported case in most months from 2010 to 2023. <br/>
- Minor spikes in cases are observed occasionally - specifically in October 2011, October 2016, June 2018, August & September 2020, July 2021, July 2022, and June 2023. All spikes exhibit only a single case. <br/>
- Between 2010 and 2023, there have been just two reported Diphtheria-related deaths, occurring in November 2010 and September 2012. <br/>
- The zero case count throughout the majority of 2023 suggests an effective vaccination protocol and indicates a successful public health control of Diphtheria in mainland China.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data demonstrates an extremely low incidence of diphtheria in mainland China over the examined period (2010 - 2023). Cases surfaced sporadically without any discernible pattern of seasonal or yearly recurrence. Specifically, single case instances were observed in October 2011, October 2016, June 2018, August and September 2020, July 2021, July 2022, and June 2023. The rest of the months within this period recorded no cases. This low prevalence reflects the effectiveness of immunization strategies, reaffirming that diphtheria is effectively controlled in this region.

### Deaths Analysis
From the data, overall mortalities related to diphtheria are minimal in mainland China. There were two separate incidents involving a total of 9 deaths in 2010 and 2012, recorded in November 2010 and September 2012 respectively. It is noteworthy that these fatalities occurred in months isolated from case occurrences, indicating possible reporting delays. The absence of deaths subsequent to 2012 signifies advances in disease management. The sustained zero mortalities over an extensive time further affirm that diphtheria poses minimal health threat in mainland China.

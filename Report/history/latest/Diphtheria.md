## Introduction

Diphtheria is a serious, contagious bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It typically affects the mucous membranes of the throat and nose, exhibiting signs such as sore throat, fever, and swollen glands. If untreated, it can lead to potential complications, including paralysis and heart failure. The disease is largely preventable through vaccination. It spreads through respiratory droplets, personal contact, or shared objects. The diphtheria toxin produced by the bacteria is the main damaging factor, destroying healthy tissues in the respiratory system.
## Highlights

- The data reflects a very low incidence of Diphtheria in the Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023, with sporadic cases observed in certain months but no widespread outbreaks. <br/>
- Notable is the occurrence of eight deaths in November 2010; however, there were no reported cases associated with these deaths, suggesting possible underreporting or a lag in diagnosis reporting. <br/>
- Subsequent years show minimal deaths and cases, with only single cases occurring in October 2011, September 2012, October 2016, June 2018, August and September 2020, July 2021, and July 2022, without any associated fatalities. <br/>
- As of November 2023, there have been no reported cases or deaths, indicating effective control and possibly strong vaccination coverage. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows that the Chinese mainland had sporadic cases of diphtheria from 2010 to 2023, with cases recorded only in November 2011, October 2016, June 2018, August and September 2020, July 2021, July 2022, and June 2023. Each of these instances registered a single case, indicating a very low incidence rate of the disease during this extended period. Most months and years reported zero cases, which may reflect the effectiveness of the ongoing vaccination and public health programs targeting diphtheria.

### Deaths Analysis
Regarding fatalities, the data reveals an interesting anomaly with eight deaths reported in November 2010 despite no cases being recorded, suggesting possible data entry errors or a lag in case reporting. Another death is reported in September 2012, also without a corresponding case. The remainder of the timeframe reports no deaths, indicating either an effective treatment response when cases do occur or the low virulence of the strains present. The disparity between case and death data necessitates further investigation for potential underreporting or misclassification of cases.

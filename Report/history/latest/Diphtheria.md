## Introduction

Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection typically affecting the mucous membranes of the nose and throat. The disease is highly contagious and primarily spread through direct personal contact or through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It's characterized by a thick, gray membrane covering the throat and tonsils, sore throat, fever, and swollen glands. Without treatment, diphtheria can cause severe damage to kidneys, nervous system, and heart. Vaccinations effectively prevent the disease and are usually given in childhood as part of routine immunizations.
## Highlights

- Diphtheria in mainland China has shown rare and sporadic occurrences with only 5 reported cases and no deaths from November 2013 to November 2023. <br/>
- Cases were reported singularly in October 2016, June 2018, August and September 2020, and July 2021 and 2022. <br/>
- No consistent seasonal pattern or increase in incidence is evident, and the overall case count remains extremely low. <br/>
- The absence of reported deaths may indicate effective clinical management and possibly a well-established vaccination program. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2013 to 2023, Chinese mainland recorded sporadic occurrences of diphtheria. A total of 5 cases were reported, each occurring independently in October 2016, June 2018, August and September 2020, and July 2021. There was a consistent lull in cases until June 2023, where one additional case emerged. The data suggests a rare incidence of the disease with instances interspersed over a decade. The absence of outbreaks or consistent case reports indicates strong control measures, likely due to widespread vaccination and effective public health surveillance.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the given timeframe, there have been no reported deaths due to diphtheria in Chinese mainland. The zero mortality rate alongside the minimal case reports indicates that the health system effectively managed the few cases that did arise. This may reflect high levels of immunity within the population, quick diagnosis, and prompt administration of treatment. The fatality rate for diphtheria has been effectively minimized, possibly due to the efficacy of the diphtheria toxoid vaccine and comprehensive immunization programs.

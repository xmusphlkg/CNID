## Introduction

Dysentery is an inflammatory disease of the intestines, majorly the colon. It's primarily characterized by severe diarrhea containing mucus or blood, accompanied by pain, fever, and abdominal cramps. The leading causes are bacteria such as Shigella or certain types of Escherichia coli, and parasites like Entamoeba histolytica. Transmission occurs mainly via fecal-oral route, accentuated by poor sanitation conditions. Early diagnosis and proper treatment, often involving rehydration and antibiotics, are essential to avoid severe health repercussions and curb its spread.
## Highlights

1. Dramatic reduction in cases over time: From a peak of over 41,000 reported cases in August 2010, we see a consistent trend of decreasing dysentery cases down to less than 2,000 in November 2023.<br/>
2. Seasonal Trends: The data exhibits a pattern of seasonal surges. Every year, cases typically peak during the summer months (June, July, August) while dropping to their lowest in the winter months (December, January, February).<br/>
3. Unusual mortality event in 2012: September 2012 stands out as experiencing an exceptionally high mortality rate (198 deaths), contrasting the regular 0-3 deaths per month.<br/>
4. Dramatic reduction in mortality: Since 2013, dysentery mortality rates have decreased significantly, with many months reporting no deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Reviewing the reported cases data for dysentery in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 reveals a relatively consistent annual pattern. Typically, recorded cases of dysentery peak between June and August, aligning with the warmer months which can favor conditions for transmission. Exceptionally high cases were observed in August 2010 and 2011, with over 40,000 and 38,000 cases respectively. It is notable that over the studied period, the number of monthly cases generally decreased, from an annual average of about 18,000 per month in 2010 down to around 3,200 per month in 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
The dysentery death toll remains fairly low compared to the number of cases, implying a high survival rate. However, an unusual spike occurred in September 2012, with 198 reported deaths. Otherwise, most months saw between 0-3 deaths, even during peak case periods. Despite fluctuations, deaths due to dysentery reveal a gradual declining trend over the years, implying possible improvements in public health measures or clinical management. Notably, no death was reported from January to March 2023, indicating significant advances in dysentery control and treatment strategies.

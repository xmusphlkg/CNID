Seasonal Patterns: Dysentery cases in mainland China exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern over the years. The number of cases tends to rise from January to a peak in either July or August, and then gradually decline towards the end of the year.

Peak and Trough Periods: Dysentery cases in mainland China consistently reach their peak during the summer months, particularly in July and August. Conversely, the number of cases is relatively low during the winter months, especially in December and January.

Overall Trends: There has been a notable upward trend in dysentery cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. The monthly cases begin at around 8,000 in 2010 and reach a peak of approximately 47,000 in 2018. Following this peak, there is a gradual decline in the number of cases, dropping to around 4,700 per month in July 2023.

Discussion: The observed seasonal patterns in dysentery cases in mainland China suggest a higher transmission rate during the summer months, possibly due to factors such as increased travel, outdoor activities, and higher temperatures that favor bacterial growth. The declining trend in the number of cases after 2018 is an encouraging sign and could indicate the effectiveness of prevention and control strategies implemented by public health interventions. However, it remains crucial to remain vigilant and continue monitoring the situation to prevent future outbreaks and sustain the downward trend in dysentery cases.

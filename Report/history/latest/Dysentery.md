## Introduction

Dysentery is an infectious disease characterized by inflammation of the intestines, primarily the colon. It's typically caused by the bacteria Shigella or the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. The primary symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and severe dehydration. Dysentery spreads mainly through contaminated food or water due to poor hygiene and sanitation. While it's prevalent in developing nations with poor sanitary conditions, dysentery can occur anywhere. Most recover with appropriate hydration and antibiotics, but in severe cases, it can be fatal. Understanding its cause and prevention can reduce the risk of dysentery.
## Highlights

- The number of cases of dysentery in Chinese mainland has shown a declining trend over the years, from a peak of 41,507 cases in August 2010 to 1,963 cases in November 2023. <br/>
- Mortality rates have remained consistently low, with zero to a few reported deaths per month, with occasional spikes such as the 198 deaths reported in September 2012. <br/>
- The data does not reveal any significant seasonal pattern in the recent years, although earlier years (2010 - 2011) showed increased cases during summer months. <br/>
- The disease has largely been controlled with a notably steep decline in the number of cases from 2010 to 2023, indicating effective public health measures and interventions. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to November 2023, Dysentery cases in Chinese mainland demonstrate a notable seasonality with peaks typically occurring in the summer months (June to August), and a gradual decrease through the years. Cases reached their zenith in August 2010 with 41,507 reported incidents. Since then, there has been an overall downward trend, with cases significantly dropping to 1,963 by November 2023. The data indicates improved control and possibly better hygiene practices over the studied period.

### Deaths Analysis
Dysentery-associated deaths from 2010 to 2023 indicate low mortality overall, with most months recording zero to three deaths. A stark anomaly occurs in September 2012 with 198 deaths, suggesting a possible severe outbreak or co-occurring event requiring further investigation. Excluding this outlier, the trend in fatalities is declining or remains consistently low across the years. This pattern suggests effective clinical management and possibly increased access to medical care, aligning with the descending case numbers over the same period.

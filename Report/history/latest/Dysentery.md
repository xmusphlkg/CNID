## Introduction

Dysentery is an inflammatory disorder of the intestine, particularly of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing blood and mucus in the feces. It can be caused by either bacterial pathogens such as Shigella, Campylobacter, or E. coli, or by protozoan parasites like Entamoeba histolytica. The disease is typically spread through contaminated food or water and through person-to-person contact, often in areas with poor sanitation. Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, and urgent need to defecate. Treatment varies depending on the cause and may include antibiotics or antiparasitic medications, hydration, and rest.

## Highlights

- Dysentery cases in mainland China have shown a clear decreasing trend over the years, with a peak in 2010 and a significant reduction by October 2023. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns are evident, with cases typically increasing in the warmer months (May to August) and declining during the cooler months (November to April). <br/>
- Mortality has remained low with sporadic peaks, such as the unusual spike in September 2012, but deaths have generally been rare in the observed period. <br/>
- The public health interventions and improvements in sanitary conditions might have contributed to the continuous decrease in both morbidity and mortality associated with dysentery. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from 2010 to 2023 reveal a distinct seasonality in dysentery cases across mainland China, peaking during the summer months (June to August) and declining during winter. The highest number of cases recorded in a single month was 41,507 in August 2010, followed by a trend of decreasing annual peaks. A possible anomaly is observed in September 2012 with 23399 cases and an unusually high death toll. The recent years from 2020 to 2023 have shown a reduction in case numbers, potentially indicating improved public health measures, reporting changes, or other socio-environmental factors influencing transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, the number of deaths per month due to dysentery has generally been low, with a notable spike in September 2012 (198 deaths), warranting investigation into specific causes or reporting errors. Excluding this outlier, mortalities have remained in single digits or zero, suggesting a relatively low case-fatality ratio. The trend over the years does not display clear seasonality in deaths, with sporadic occurrences that are not evidently linked to the peaks in cases. This could indicate effective clinical management of cases and/or increased access to medical care and treatment options.

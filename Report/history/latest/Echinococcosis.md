## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworms Echinococcus granulosus or Echinococcus multilocularis. These parasites commonly infect animals like dogs and livestock but can also infect humans. The infection occurs through ingestion of parasitic eggs present in contaminated food, water, or soil. In humans, Echinococcosis results in the formation of cysts within organs, primarily the liver and lungs, and can lead to severe health complications if left untreated. Prevention measures include proper handwashing, food safety practices, and controlling the infection in animal populations.
## Highlights

- Periodic case spikes occur annually around December in mainland China, with a diminishing pattern of peaks observed in recent years, suggesting a gradual decrease in Echinococcosis incidence. <br/>
- A notable sustained reduction in cases is evident from early 2022, continuing through November 2023, indicating an improving epidemiological situation. <br/>
- Mortality remains very low, with sporadic deaths, implying either a low fatality rate or efficient treatment protocols. <br/>
- Missing data for early 2013 and an abrupt drop in February 2020 cases could reflect reporting disruptions, potentially due to external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicates a fluctuating trend of echinococcosis cases in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023, with noticeable peaks and troughs. The highest number of cases was reported in March 2017 (1077 cases), and there is a consistent increase in cases towards the end of each year, peaking in December. The sharp decrease in February 2020 to 91 cases might be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting healthcare services and reporting rates. A general uptick in cases is observed from the beginning of each year, followed by a mid-year dip and an end-of-year rise.

### Deaths Analysis
Echinococcosis-related mortality remained consistently low from January 2010 to November 2023, with only 7 reported deaths in the entire time frame. Deaths are sporadic with no identifiable pattern or increase over time, suggesting that while echinococcosis has a presence in the mainland, it is not a common cause of death. Two deaths reported in February 2019 represent the highest mortality in a single month. The low fatality rate may indicate effective treatment or management of the disease when cases are identified.

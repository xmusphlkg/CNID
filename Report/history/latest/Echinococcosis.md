## Introduction

Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with tiny tapeworms of the genus *Echinococcus*. It occurs in two main forms: cystic echinococcosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, caused by *Echinococcus granulosus*, and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), caused by *Echinococcus multilocularis*. Infection is transmitted to humans through ingestion of parasite eggs in contaminated food, water, or soil, or through direct contact with host animals. The disease is characterized by the slow growth of cysts in various organs, mainly the liver and lungs, and can cause severe complications if untreated.

## Highlights

- Echinococcosis cases in mainland China have seen fluctuations over the years 2010-2023, with a notable peak in the number of cases (1,077 cases) in March 2017. Since then, rates have generally declined.<br/>
- September 2023 data suggests the current situation is stable without a sudden surge or drop in cases; 367 cases were reported with no deaths.<br/>
- Deaths are extremely low relative to the number of cases, pointing towards a possibly effective healthcare response or potentially low fatality rate of the disease.<br/>
- Data shows a trend of more Echinococcosis cases reported towards the end and at the beginning of each year, hinting towards a seasonal pattern.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
(108 words)

There were steady rises and falls in Echinococcosis cases reported in mainland China between 2010 and 2023. Peaks were typically observed during winter months or early spring: December 2010, November 2011, December 2012, November 2013, March 2015, March 2016, March 2017, November 2017, December 2018, February 2019, November 2019, and March 2021. Most likely, the spikes in Echinococcosis cases correspond with increased human contact with host animals due to agricultural cycles or livestock production practices. Conversely, falls typically occurred over summer periods, reaching the lowest in 2022 and 2023, potentially indicating growing public health measures or changes in animal handling practices.

### Deaths Analysis
(108 words)

Recorded Echinococcosis deaths were extremely low throughout the 13-year period analysed, with occasional fatalities reportedâ€”March and April 2010, February 2012, April 2013, July 2015, March and April 2016, February and May 2019, November 2019, November and December 2020, and July 2021. Despite fluctuations in diagnosed cases, the mortality rate remained consistently negligible. This suggests effective medical management of Echinococcosis infections in the region, as treatment outcomes seem to keep fatalities at bay. However, the periods of reported deaths coincide with some peak case periods, indicating a correlation between high infection rates and increased mortality events, though the overall impact is minor.

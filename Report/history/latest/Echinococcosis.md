## Introduction

Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus tapeworms. Humans contract this disease through ingestion of parasitic eggs, often through contact with infected animals or consumption of contaminated food or water. It presents two primary forms: Cystic echinococcosis (also known as hydatid disease) and Alveolar echinococcosis. Both forms lead to growth of cysts, typically in the liver and lungs, causing various health issues. If untreated, the disease can be fatal. Despite being preventable, Echinococcosis is classified as a neglected tropical disease due its prevalence in impoverished regions.
## Highlights

- Echinococcosis cases in the Chinese mainland display a cyclical pattern with peaks and troughs throughout the years, suggesting seasonality influence. Peaks are often observed around December to March, while troughs tend to occur in late summer or early autumn (e.g., September to November). <br/>
- Mortality due to echinococcosis is exceedingly low, with only a few documented cases of death over the sampled years. This implies that while echinococcosis infection rates can be variable, the condition may be manageable or has a low death rate in the context of the Chinese healthcare system. <br/>
- The highest number of cases over the sampled time frame occurred in March 2017, with 1,077 cases, whereas the lowest number of cases occurred in November 2022, with just 97 cases, indicating a potential decrease in the number of occurrences or improved control measures. <br/>
- Recent trends show stabilization in the number of monthly cases, ranging from 240 to 387 cases in the last year, with November 2023 reporting 387 cases and zero deaths, suggesting ongoing transmission but controlled fatal outcomes. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, the reported cases of Echinococcosis in the Chinese mainland show fluctuations, with a noticeable peak in 2017 March (1077 cases). The monthly cases generally range between 100 and 500. Notable upticks are observed towards the end of each year, suggesting possible seasonal patterns or improved surveillance. A significant drop occurred in February 2020, which may correlate with the COVID-19 lockdowns impacting diagnosis or reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
Echinococcosis-related deaths are remarkably low, with only 9 recorded fatalities over 13 years. The highest mortality was noted in February 2019 (2 deaths). The majority of years had zero or single annual fatalities, which might reflect the effectiveness of treatment or the non-lethal nature of infections in the region. It is necessary to investigate whether underreporting, misdiagnosis, or successful interventions contribute to the low death rate.

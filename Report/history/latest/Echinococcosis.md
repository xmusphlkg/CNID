## Introduction

Echinococcosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus tapeworms. It occurs in two main forms - cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), primarily differentiated by their caused species. Humans contract the disease through ingestion of parasite eggs in contaminated food, water, or soil, or through direct contact with animal hosts. The parasites form cysts in organs like the liver and lungs, leading to serious health complications if not treated. Although globally distributed, it's particularly endemic in pastoral and farming regions. Echinococcosis remains a public health concern due to its high morbidity and mortality rates.
## Highlights

- Echinococcosis cases in Chinese mainland show periodic fluctuations over the years, with a peak of 1077 cases in March 2017. <br/>
- There are occasional fatalities reported, with a total of six deaths since 2013, indicating a low mortality rate associated with the disease. <br/>
- From 2020 through 2023, the number of reported cases decreased notably compared to previous years, suggesting possible improvements in control and prevention measures. <br/>
- As of November 2023, there is an observed increase in cases to 387, reminding that vigilance and continued public health efforts are necessary to combat Echinococcosis. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Echinococcosis in China from November 2013 to November 2023 indicates fluctuating case numbers without a clear seasonal trend. Initially, monthly cases ranged between 287-448, but a significant increase occurred from March 2017, with 1,077 cases being the highest reported. After this peak, case counts fluctuated, briefly decreasing during February 2020 (91 cases), potentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting healthcare-seeking behaviors or reporting practices. The following years showed a decline, with the lowest post-peak values of 97-144 in late 2022.

### Deaths Analysis
During the same period, Echinococcosis-associated deaths were extremely rare, with the first reported death occurring in July 2015. A total of 7 deaths were reported across the entire time frame, indicating a low case-fatality rate for Echinococcosis in mainland China. Notably, February 2019 saw the highest mortality, with two deaths reported. It is worth mentioning that the data shows zero deaths for many months, which might indicate effective clinical management and/or under-reporting of fatal cases.

## Introduction

Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) is a severe viral illness, typically characterized by fever, malaise, bleeding disorders, and shock. It is caused by a variety of viruses, such as the Hantaviruses or Dengue virus, which can be transmitted through rodents, insects, or contaminated aerosols. Symptoms often progress from initial fever and weakness to more severe hemorrhagic manifestations. Despite varying mortality rates, depending on the causative virus, EHF generally has a high morbidity and requires immediate medical assistance. Vaccines and specific treatments are limited, making preventive measures crucial.
## Highlights

- A consistent seasonal pattern is observed with cases peaking in November each year, followed by a gradual decline through the winter and spring months. <br/>
- There has been a notable reduction in both cases and fatalities over the years, with the latest data showing 1,320 cases and 3 deaths in November 2023. <br/>
- The case fatality rate has decreased, suggesting improvements in disease management or reporting accuracy. <br/>
- The lowest case counts consistently occur in the late summer months, with a steady increase in the autumn.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
An analysis of epidemic hemorrhagic fever from November 2013 to November 2023 on the Chinese mainland reveals fluctuating case counts, with notable peaks during winter months, particularly in November and December each year. Seasonal trends show a decrease in cases during the summer, with fewer cases consistently reported in August and September. The highest number of cases occurred in December 2021 (2402 cases), while the lowest was in September 2022 (205 cases). Inter-annual variability is evident, but a recurrent seasonal pattern is clear, indicative of environmental or behavioral factors influencing transmission dynamics.

### Deaths Analysis
From November 2013 to November 2023, death counts associated with epidemic hemorrhagic fever on the Chinese mainland followed a similar seasonal pattern to case reports, with a decline during summer months and an elevation in winter. The highest fatality count was observed in November 2018 (33 deaths), while multiple months reported no deaths, such as February and September 2022. The overall fatality ratio fluctuates, implying variability in disease severity, access to care, or reporting accuracy over time. Despite fluctuations, the number of deaths typically correlates with case numbers, suggesting a consistent case-fatality ratio.

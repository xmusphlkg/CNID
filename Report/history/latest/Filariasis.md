## Introduction

Filariasis is a parasitic disease caused by an infection with roundworms of the Filarioidea type. These are spread by blood-feeding black flies and mosquitoes. There are eight known filarial worms that use humans as their host. These are divided into three groups according to the body area they affect: lymphatic, subcutaneous, and serous cavity filariasis. Symptoms may not appear until years after infection, but they usually include conditions like lymphoedema, elephantiasis and river blindness. The disease is most common in tropical and subtropical areas.
## Highlights

- The data from the past decade shows that Filariasis is nearly eliminated in Chinese mainland, with only two cases reported and no fatalities. <br/>
- Since November 2023, there have been consistent zero reported cases and deaths, reflecting the effectiveness of China's disease control and surveillance. <br/>
- The isolated cases in November 2014 and August 2021 imply rare transmission events, suggesting a disrupted endemic cycle. <br/>
- These trends signify a potential move towards the WHO's certification of Filariasis elimination in the region. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From November 2013 to November 2023, Chinese mainland reported only two cases of filariasis, with one case each in November 2014 and August 2021, and zero cases in all other months. The nearly decade-long period reflects a highly successful containment and prevention strategy, highlighting the effectiveness of public health interventions, possibly including vector control, health education, and antifilarial drug distribution. The data suggests a sustained elimination of transmission, considering the former endemic nature of the disease in the region.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the monitored period from 2013 to 2023, no deaths were reported due to filariasis in the Chinese mainland. This outcome indicates an absence of lethal cases and suggests that any infections that did occur were either asymptomatic or managed effectively with appropriate medical treatment. The zero mortality rate aligns with the low incidence of cases and supports the success of China's filariasis eradication programs, signifying robust surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and effective treatment protocols.

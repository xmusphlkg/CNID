Overall Trends: Overall, there has been a gradual increase in Gonorrhea cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 June.

This is evident from the increasing number of cases reported during the peak seasons, as well as the general rise in cases over the years.

Discussion: The seasonal patterns observed for Gonorrhea in mainland China indicate a higher transmission risk during the summer months, which can be attributed to factors such as increased sexual activity, more frequent travel, and higher temperatures.

The overall upward trend in Gonorrhea cases highlights the need for continued public health interventions, comprehensive sexual education, and targeted prevention strategies in mainland China.

## Introduction

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium, typically spreading through sexual contact. Common symptoms include painful urination, abnormal discharge, and, in women, pelvic pain. However, many individuals may remain asymptomatic. If untreated, serious complications can occur, including infertility and increased susceptibility to other STIs. Gonorrhea can be prevented through safe sexual practices and can be treated with antibiotics, although antibiotic resistance is increasing globally.
## Highlights

- Steady increase in gonorrhea cases from 2010 to 2023, with periodic fluctuations. <br/>
- Noticeable trough in cases in February 2020, likely due to COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. <br/>
- Very few deaths associated with gonorrhea, indicating effective treatment or low disease severity. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the number of cases (10,065) represents a maintained high transmission level with no reported deaths. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Gonorrhea in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023 display variability with seasonal patterns, often peaking mid-year. Starting with 8865 cases in January 2010, there's an upward trend, with occasional declines such as noted in February years (e.g., 6660 cases in 2010 to 6589 cases in 2023). A significant drop is observed in February 2020 (3524 cases), likely due to COVID-19 disruptions. Overall, cases have increased over the years, with a high of 13803 in August 2017.

### Deaths Analysis
Gonorrhea deaths are remarkably low, with numerous months reporting zero fatalities. Starting in January 2011, the first death was recorded, with occasional sporadic single fatalities following until a notable spike of ten deaths in September 2012. After that, deaths remained at one or zero, except for four deaths in January 2020. The overall death toll is minimal compared to the case numbers, indicating a low fatality rate for Gonorrhea in the Chinese mainland during this period.

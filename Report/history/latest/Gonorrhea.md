## Introduction

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Typically contracted through unprotected sexual contact, it primarily affects the mucous membranes of the urethra, cervix, rectum, and throat. Symptoms include burning sensations during urination, discharge, or bleeding between periods in women, though many cases remain asymptomatic. If untreated, gonorrhea can lead to serious complications such as infertility or disseminated gonococcal infection. Regular screening and usage of protection during sex are key prevention measures.
## Highlights

- Upward trend in gonorrhea cases from 2010 to 2023, with a gradual increase in incidence despite slight fluctuations. <br/>
- Seasonal variation observed, showing lower case numbers early in the year with peaks typically in mid-to-late year. <br/>
- Deaths remain extremely low considering the rise in cases, suggesting effective management of disease severity. <br/>
- Notable decline in cases starting in 2022, possibly indicating the impact of public health measures or changes in population behavior. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Gonorrhea in China's mainland from 2010 to 2023 shows fluctuations with a general upward trend in cases over the years. The lowest number of cases recorded was in February 2020 (3524 cases), a period coinciding with the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and the imposition of strict lockdown measures. Typically, monthly cases oscillated between 6000 to 13000, with the highest peak in August 2017 (13803 cases). Seasonal variations are observable, with cases often reducing in February, possibly due to the Chinese New Year holidays impacting reporting and sexual activity patterns.

### Deaths Analysis
Gonorrhea-related deaths in mainland China are extremely rare throughout the observed period, with only sporadic fatalities recorded despite the substantial number of cases. There was an unusual increase to 10 deaths in September 2012, whereas all other months reported 0 to 4 deaths. This might imply either underreporting, effective treatment strategies, or potentially a reporting anomaly. A mortality count above zero is inconsistent and seems unrelated to the case count, indicating that fatalities may not be directly proportional to the number of cases reported each month.

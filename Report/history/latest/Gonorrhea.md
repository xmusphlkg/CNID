## Introduction

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It affects both men and women, commonly involving the genital tract, rectum, and throat. Infection can result in various symptoms including painful urination and abnormal discharge, although some individuals remain asymptomatic. Untreated gonorrhea can lead to serious complications like pelvic inflammatory disease in women and infertility in both sexes. Gonorrhea is typically diagnosed via bacterial culture or nucleic acid amplification tests and is treatable with antibiotics, though antibiotic-resistant strains are a growing concern globally.

## Highlights

- Gonorrhea cases in mainland China showed substantial fluctuation with a general increasing trend from 2010 to a peak around 2017, followed by a noticeable decline after 2018.<br/>
- The highest number of cases reported in a single month was 13,803 in August 2017, while the lowest after this peak was 4,762 in January 2023, highlighting a significant reduction in case numbers.<br/>
- The data indicates sporadic instances of mortality, with the highest reported deaths (4) in January 2020, suggesting fatalities are relatively rare or underreported.<br/>
- As of October 2023, there are 10,328 reported cases of Gonorrhea with no associated deaths, suggesting continued transmission with potential under-detection or effective management of severe cases.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Reported cases of gonorrhea in mainland China from January 2010 to October 2023 show substantial variability with noticeable seasonal trends. Annually, the lowest rates typically appeared during the early part of the year, with February often exhibiting the lowest case counts. A general upward trend in cases is evident across the years, peaking in 2017. A significant dip in case numbers occurs in February 2020, likely due to public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, but a quick rebound follows. Recent data from 2023 indicates continued transmission, maintaining high case numbers.

### Deaths Analysis
Gonorrhea is typically a non-fatal sexually transmitted infection; mortality data between January 2010 and October 2023 reflect this, with the vast majority of months reporting zero deaths. The sparse fatalities reported are isolated incidents, with no discernible trend or seasonal pattern. A notable anomaly is September 2012, with 10 reported deaths, which requires further epidemiological investigation to understand causality. Otherwise, mortality remains exceptionally low, suggesting effective treatment and management protocols for gonorrhea complications in mainland China.

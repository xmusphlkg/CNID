## Introduction

Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a contagious illness primarily affecting children under 5, but can also occur in older children and adults. It's caused by various viruses; the common ones are coxsackievirus and enterovirus. HFMD presents as fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, followed by painful, red blisters on the tongue, gums, hands, and feet. In rare severe cases, viral meningitis or encephalitis may occur. The disease generally resolves on its own in 7-10 days. Good personal hygiene can prevent its spread.
## Highlights

- Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) shows clear seasonal patterns with peak incidence typically occurring between May and July annually, as demonstrated by a high number of cases during these months across the analyzed years. <br/>
- After the dramatic dip in cases in 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated measures, there has been a gradual recovery in the number of HFMD cases, reaching pre-pandemic levels by mid-2023. <br/>
- The fatality rate has significantly decreased over time, with no deaths reported since November 2022, suggesting improvements in public health interventions, treatment, and possibly changes in circulating viral strains. <br/>
- The current disease situation as of November 2023 shows a decline in the number of cases (92,955), consistent with the usual decrease in cases entering the winter months and no associated deaths, indicating good disease control measures. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Seasonal variation is evident in the Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) data from Chinese mainland, with peaks usually occurring from April to July each year. Starting with the year 2010, there was a sharp increase in cases during these months, often crossing 200,000 and reaching over 500,000 by 2014. The pattern remained consistent until 2019, after which there was a dramatic decline in cases starting in 2020, potentially due to public health interventions, including measures taken for the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2023, the reported data indicates a resurgence in cases, albeit not reaching pre-2020 levels.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to HFMD peaked concurrently with the number of cases, most notably from 2010 to 2014, with the highest fatalities in 2010 May (186 deaths) and 2012 May (132 deaths). However, the fatality rate decreased significantly in subsequent years, especially from 2020 onwards, coinciding with a decrease in case numbers. This could reflect improved healthcare interventions and reporting accuracy. Since 2020, monthly deaths have been close to zero, even with the rise in cases in 2023, suggesting better management and possibly lower severity of circulating viral strains.

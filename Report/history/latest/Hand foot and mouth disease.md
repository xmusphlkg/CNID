## Introduction

Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a contagious illness caused primarily by the Coxsackievirus. Typically affecting children under the age of 5, HFMD is characterized by sores in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet. Other symptoms can include fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, and lethargy. HFMD is spread through direct contact with saliva, mucus, or feces from an infected person. While there is no specific treatment, the symptoms can be managed with over-the-counter remedies for pain and fever. It usually resolves spontaneously within 1 week.

## Highlights

- Seasonal peaks in spring and summer, with the highest case numbers reported between May and July, suggesting warm weather may play a role in transmission dynamics. <br/>
- A marked decrease in cases and deaths since 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic response measures such as increased hygiene practices and reduced public gatherings. <br/>
- No reported deaths from Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in November 2023, indicating improved disease management or underreporting. <br/>
- A resurgence in cases in June and July 2023 following a substantial decline in cases reported in early 2023, warranting close surveillance to prevent potential outbreaks. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) cases in China from 2010 to 2023 show seasonality, peaking notably each April to July with a decline towards winter. In 2020, a dramatic decrease in cases coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic onset and associated control measures, with unusual lows persisting into 2021. The following years demonstrate an eventual return towards previous patterns. The highest recorded month was May 2012, reaching 462,116 cases, while post-pandemic months in 2023 are rebounding but remain below peak historical figures.

### Deaths Analysis
Fatal cases of HFMD show a similarly seasonal pattern, with most deaths occurring in the peak seasons of April to July. There's a decrease in fatalities correlating with the decrease in overall cases in 2020, though the fatality rate is not necessarily lower during that period. The highest death count is observed in May 2010, with 186 deaths. From 2018 onwards, there's a noticeable reduction in deaths, even as case numbers remained significant pre-pandemic, suggesting improved clinical management and control measures. Post-2020, HFMD deaths are minimal, with numerous months reporting zero fatalities.

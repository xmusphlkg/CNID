Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the provided data on hand foot and mouth disease cases in mainland China from January 2010 to June 2023, we can identify seasonal patterns. The number of cases tends to show a clear seasonality, with higher numbers of cases occurring during the summer and early autumn months. This pattern repeats annually, with peaks observed around June, July, and August, and decreasing numbers of cases during the winter months.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak periods for hand foot and mouth disease cases in mainland China occur during the summer months, with the highest number of cases observed in June. This is followed by a gradual decrease in cases during the autumn and winter months, reaching a trough period during the winter season, with the lowest number of cases typically reported in January and February.

Overall Trends:
When considering the overall trends of hand foot and mouth disease cases in mainland China from January 2010 to June 2023, there is a noticeable increase in the number of cases over time. The data shows that the number of cases started to rise from 2010 onwards, with fluctuations observed on a yearly basis. However, there is an overall upward trend in the number of cases, with the highest number of cases reported in June 2023.

Discussion:
The seasonal pattern of hand foot and mouth disease cases in mainland China is consistent with the known characteristics of the disease, as it tends to be more prevalent during warm and humid weather conditions. The higher transmission rates during the summer months can be attributed to increased outdoor activities and close contact among individuals, facilitating the spread of the virus.

The peak period of hand foot and mouth disease cases in June aligns with the summer vacation period when children have more opportunities for social interaction and are more likely to be exposed to the virus. The decrease in cases during the winter months can be attributed to the colder weather and reduced outdoor activities, leading to a lower transmission rate.

The overall upward trend in hand foot and mouth disease cases over time may reflect several factors, including increased awareness and reporting of cases, improved surveillance systems, and changes in population demographics or behaviors that contribute to the spread of the virus. Public health interventions such as hygiene practices and disease control measures should be strengthened, particularly during peak periods, to reduce transmission and mitigate the impact of the disease.

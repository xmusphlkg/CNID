Seasonal Patterns:

Based on the provided data, Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) exhibits a consistent seasonal pattern in mainland China, with cases increasing during the summer months and decreasing during the winter months. This suggests a clear seasonal pattern, indicating higher transmission and occurrence of HFMD during warmer months.

Peak and Trough Periods:

The peak period for HFMD cases in mainland China is observed from June to August, with the highest number of cases occurring during these months. This indicates that the summer season is the peak period for HFMD transmission. Conversely, the trough period for HFMD cases is during the winter months, particularly from December to February, with a generally lower number of cases during this time.

Overall Trends:

Overall, the data demonstrates an increasing trend in HFMD cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2013, reaching its highest number of cases in 2012. After 2013, there is a fluctuating pattern with some years showing an increase or decrease in cases compared to the previous year. However, it is important to note that a significant increase in HFMD cases has been recorded starting from 2016, with the highest number of cases reported in July 2023.

Discussion:

The seasonal pattern and peak periods of HFMD in mainland China suggest that the disease is influenced by climatic factors, with higher transmission occurring during warmer months. This is consistent with the typical pattern of enteroviral diseases, including HFMD, which tend to thrive in the summer due to increased outdoor activities and close contact among individuals.

The overall increasing trend in HFMD cases from 2010 to 2013, followed by a fluctuating pattern in subsequent years, may be influenced by various factors, such as changes in population susceptibility, improved surveillance and reporting systems, and implemented interventions to control the disease.

Continued monitoring and study of the epidemiology of HFMD in mainland China are crucial to understanding the factors contributing to the increasing trend and implementing effective prevention and control strategies. This may include promoting hygiene practices, ensuring proper sanitation, and strengthening public health interventions during peak periods.

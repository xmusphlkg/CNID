## Introduction

Hepatitis A is a contagious viral infection that affects the liver, causing inflammation and potentially impairing its function. It is primarily transmittable through contaminated food and water or close contact with an infected person. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and jaundice. Although there is no specific treatment, a safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent the disease. Improved sanitation and food safety are crucial to controlling its spread.
## Highlights

- A declining trend in Hepatitis A cases has been observed over the years in Chinese mainland, with cases decreasing from peaks over 3000 in 2010 to around 1000 by November 2023. <br/>
- The mortality rate associated with Hepatitis A has remained low, with many months reporting zero deaths, indicating effective clinical management or lower disease virulence. <br/>
- An atypical spike of 56 deaths was seen in May 2012, suggesting a possible outbreak or change in reporting during that period. <br/>
- The recent data from January 2023 to November 2023 show a relatively stable pattern of reported cases with no recorded deaths, suggesting sustained control measures and potential impacts of vaccination programs. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Hepatitis A in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 show fluctuations, with a general decreasing trend over time. The highest recorded cases occurred in August 2010, with 3,789 reported instances. Seasonal variations are noticeable, with peaks often in summer months such as July and August. The data indicates a significant drop in cases from 2020 onward, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting possible impact from public health measures or underreporting due to overwhelmed healthcare systems.

### Deaths Analysis
Hepatitis A-related mortality in the dataset is relatively low, with most months reporting zero or one death. An outlier is observed in May 2012, with an unexplained spike of 56 deaths, which warrants further epidemiological investigation. Excluding this anomaly, there appears to be no clear seasonal or temporal trend in fatalities. Deaths remain sporadic and infrequent across the years, highlighting Hepatitis Aâ€™s typically low fatality rate, possibly attributed to improved healthcare response and vaccination efforts in China.

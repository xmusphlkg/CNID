Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the cases of Hepatitis A in mainland China before June 2023.

To identify seasonal patterns, peaks, and troughs, we can plot the monthly cases over time. Additionally, we can calculate the yearly averages to observe overall trends. Let's start by visualizing the data.

Here is a line plot showing the monthly Hepatitis A cases in mainland China:

From the plot, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Seasonal Patterns: There is a clear seasonal pattern in the Hepatitis A cases. The number of cases tends to increase during the summer months (June to August) and decrease during the winter months (December to February).

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Hepatitis A cases occurs in July or August, with the highest number of cases recorded during these months. The trough period for cases is observed in January or February, with the lowest number of cases during these months.

3. Overall Trends: Over the years, there is a general decreasing trend in the number of Hepatitis A cases, but there are also some fluctuations. It's important to note that the data for 2023 is only available until June, so we cannot determine the complete trend for that year.

Now let's analyze the deaths due to Hepatitis A in mainland China before June 2023.

Here is a line plot showing the monthly Hepatitis A deaths in mainland China:

From the plot, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Seasonal Patterns: Similar to the cases, there is a seasonal pattern in the Hepatitis A deaths. The number of deaths tends to increase during the summer months (June to August) and decrease during the winter months (December to February).

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Hepatitis A deaths aligns with the peak period for cases, occurring in July or August. The trough period for deaths aligns with the trough period for cases, occurring in January or February.

3. Overall Trends: Similar to the cases, there is a general decreasing trend in the number of Hepatitis A deaths over the years, with some fluctuations. It's important to note that the data for 2023 is only available until June, so we cannot determine the complete trend for that year.

Overall, the analysis of the data reveals a clear seasonal pattern for Hepatitis A cases and deaths in mainland China, with peaks occurring during the summer and troughs during the winter. There is also a decreasing trend in both cases and deaths over the years, but with some fluctuations.

Please note that further statistical analysis, such as conducting a seasonal decomposition or calculating annual trends, could provide more insights into the data.

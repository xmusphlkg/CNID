## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver, potentially causing both acute and chronic disease. Transmitted via blood, semen, or another body fluid of an infected individual, it poses significant risks such as chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Hepatitis B is preventable with a safe and effective vaccine, which has been available since 1982. Despite global vaccination programs, the World Health Organization estimates that 257 million people worldwide live with chronic Hepatitis B infection.

## Highlights

1. Hepatitis B cases in mainland China show a consistent cyclical pattern over the years, with February showing consistently lower case counts and peaks often seen around March and August. <br/>
2. The number of Hepatitis B cases has risen significantly in recent years, particularly from 2020 to 2023. As of November 2023, the number of cases is the highest recorded at 132,270. <br/>
3. Despite the increase in the number of cases, the number of deaths remains relatively low and stable, signifying possible improvements in disease management and treatment. <br/>
4. Particularly in the year 2023, the number of deaths has notably decreased, reaching 35 in November, despite the notable increase in cases. This may indicate better outcomes, suggesting effective interventions or improved healthcare measures.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Hepatitis B case count in mainland China exhibits a clear cyclical trend over the examined period (2010-2023). The case count tends to peak in the first quarter of each year, specifically around March, implying a seasonal strategy for public health interventions could be beneficial. The lowest case count can be observed in February 2020, likely due to the restrictions induced by the COVID-19 outbreak. Over the long term, the data suggests that the annual cases have been increasing, with the highest number of cases recorded in August 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
Unlike the case count, the reported fatalities do not display a consistent seasonal trend. An overall increase in deaths per month can be observed up until 2020, with a peak of 80 deaths in January 2020. However, from 2021 onwards, despite the rising number of cases, the death rate appears to be decreasing, potentially indicating improved treatment or management of Hepatitis B. Lastly, it's essential to acknowledge, with the virility of Hepatitis B, the death count remains relatively low, indicating successful case management overall.

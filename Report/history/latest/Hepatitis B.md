## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that aggressively targets the liver and can lead to chronic disease, liver cancer or death. The virus can be transmitted through contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids. While vaccines are available and offer over 90% protection, hepatitis B remains a global health threat particularly in regions that lack widespread immunization. It's critical to educate oneself about prevention measures including vaccination, safe sex practices, and avoiding non-sterile medical equipment.

## Highlights

1. Hepatitis B cases rose from 2010 to 2023, with a particularly sharp increase observed from 2022 to 2023. November 2023 exhibited the highest case rate in the dataset.<br/>
2. There is a significant reduction in deaths, suggesting improvements in healthcare or interventions. <br/>
3. Notably, there's a predictable annual dip in reported cases and deaths during the winter months (December-February).<br/>
4. Despite the nursing efforts, the disease continued to spread at an escalating rate, emphasizing the need for enhanced preventive measures.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Hepatitis B cases reported in Chinese mainland for the 2010-2023 period maintain a cyclical pattern with peaks showing in March and troughs in February. This repetitive pattern also seems to intensify gradually over the years; for instance, cases spiked from about 117k in March 2010 to about 127k in March 2023. The lowest count was in February 2020 (51k), arguably due to reduced diagnosis during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, despite minor fluctuations, the accumulated case numbers deem Hepatitis B a significant concern in the region.

### Deaths Analysis

Fatalities associated with Hepatitis B over these years demonstrate a comparatively stable trajectory, with minor monthly fluctuations ranging between averagely 17 and 80. Although progressing steadily over the period, the mortality rate appeared moderately low, indirectly reflecting the efficiency of healthcare interventions. A sharp peak to 80 deaths was observed in January 2020, presumably due to complications with the surging Covid-19 pandemic. Aside from that, the deaths seemed to be on a downward trend, emphasizing the growing control over Hepatitis B's severe consequences in Chinese mainland.

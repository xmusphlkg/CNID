## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that targets the liver, potentially causing both acute and chronic disease. It is transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids. Chronic Hepatitis B can lead to serious health issues, like cirrhosis or liver cancer. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2019, 296 million people were living with chronic Hepatitis B infection worldwide. While a vaccine has been available since 1982 and is highly effective in preventing infection, Hepatitis B remains a major global health problem.
## Highlights

- Rising trend in cases over the last decade, with cases nearly doubling from 88,479 in November 2013 to 132,270 in November 2023, showing an ongoing battle with Hepatitis B. <br/>
- Mortality rates have slightly decreased from 40 deaths in November 2013 to 35 deaths in November 2023, indicative of improved treatment or disease management. <br/>
- Seasonal fluctuations in cases suggest winter peaks, implying potential seasonal transmission patterns. <br/>
- A notable dip in cases to 59,498 in December 2022, followed by a resurgence to 138,875 in August 2023, points to potential episodic outbreaks or shifts in data collection methods. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the course of the data provided, there is a notable upward trend in the number of Hepatitis B cases in China's mainland. The cases fluctuated annually, with troughs generally observed in February, likely due to seasonal variations or reporting practices around the Chinese New Year. The most significant spikes in reported cases occurred toward the end of the dataset, with cases breaching the 130,000 mark from July 2023 onwards, peaking at 138,875 in August 2023. This suggests an expanding incidence or improved reporting mechanisms within the healthcare system.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths attributed to Hepatitis B in the dataset reveal less consistent trends than case counts, with numbers ranging between 17 to 80 fatalities per month. The highest mortality was reported in January 2020, a potential outlier or perhaps indicative of reduced healthcare capacity amidst the early COVID-19 pandemic. Over the years, despite the increase in reported cases, the death counts remained relatively stable, indicating possible improvements in treatment and management. The mortality rate decreased slightly in recent months, falling to around 20 deaths per month in late 2023.

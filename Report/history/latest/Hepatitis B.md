Discussion: 
The analysis of monthly data on Hepatitis B cases in mainland China from 2010 to July 2023 reveals both seasonal patterns and variations in case numbers. The presence of peak and trough periods suggests that certain months tend to have higher or lower incidences of cases. However, there is no clear overall trend in the data, indicating that other factors, such as vaccination efforts and public health interventions, may have played a role in the management of the disease. Further analysis and investigation will be required to explore the factors influencing these fluctuations and to develop targeted interventions effectively to reduce the burden of Hepatitis B in mainland China.

## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that severely impacts the liver functioning, potentially leading to acute or chronic disease states. The virus can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids, often during birth, sexual contact, or contaminated needles. Vaccination can prevent infection. Chronic infection can lead to serious health issues, such as cirrhosis or liver cancer. Globally, an estimated 296 million people live with a chronic hepatitis B infection. Despite being a significant health concern, many people unaware of their condition due to the mild or absent symptoms. Disease awareness and prevention are crucial.
## Highlights

- A steady increase in Hepatitis B cases has been observed in the Chinese mainland from 2010 to November 2023, with a notable rise in cases to 132,270 by November 2023. <br/>
- The mortality associated with Hepatitis B has fluctuated over the years; however, it has remained relatively low, with deaths numbering 35 in November 2023. <br/>
- Compared to the earlier years, the data shows a significant reduction in death rates per reported case, indicating potential improvements in treatment or management of the disease. <br/>
- The peak in cases observed in August 2023 (138,875 cases) represents the highest recorded number throughout the years provided, suggesting ongoing transmission or possible reporting enhancements. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to November 2023, Hepatitis B cases in Chinese mainland showed a recurring seasonal pattern, with peaks generally observed in March (e.g., 117,048 cases in 2010 and 126,932 in 2023). An unexpected decline was noted in February 2020 and December 2022, which corresponded to 51,506 and 59,498 cases respectively, potentially indicating impacts of external factors such as public health interventions or reporting anomalies. The overall trend indicates fluctuations without a clear long-term increase or decrease in the annual caseload.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to Hepatitis B from 2010 to November 2023 displayed variability, with the lowest number (12) recorded in May 2012 and the highest (80) in January 2020. Despite the monthly fluctuations, there is a general decline in fatalities over time, suggesting possible improvements in treatment or disease management. Interventions such as vaccination programs and increased access to antiviral therapies might have contributed to reducing Hepatitis B-related mortality in Chinese mainland.

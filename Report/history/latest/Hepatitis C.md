## Introduction

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that primarily attacks the liver, leading to inflammation and impaired liver function. It's caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), which spreads through contaminated blood. Symptoms often remain unnoticed until liver damage occurs. Chronic infection can lead to severe health problems such as liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. Cure is possible with antiviral medications, but no effective vaccine currently exists. Public health efforts primarily focus on harm reduction practices and early detection through screening.


## Highlights

1. There's a concerning upward trend in fatalities associated with Hepatitis C as of 2023, reaching a peak of 292 deaths in November. This increase is observed despite overall monthly cases remaining relatively stable. <br/>
2. The general pattern of new cases varies but shows a modest decline in 2022-23. However, a resurgence in cases occurs on a yearly basis around March. <br/>
3. A major drop in cases is observed in December 2022, reaching its lowest point since 2010, but the decline didn't translate into a simultaneous drop in fatalities. <br/>
4. Comparatively, the years leading to 2023 didn't showcase such spike in deaths, indicating a growing severity or possibly issues related to treatment efficacy during 2023. <br/>


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hepatitis C cases in mainland China fluctuated from 2010 to 2023 with slight annual upward trends followed by decreasing periods. In 2010, the cases ranged from 9,594 to 15,716, and by 2023, the range escalated to 12,785 to 23,625. Noticeably, the highest count occurred in February 2023 with 23,625 cases. Despite fluctuation in monthly case counts, a general upward trend can be discerned over the years, indicating an escalating public health issue. What's concerning is the sudden drop in cases towards the end of 2022 and early 2023, it would be crucial to evaluate if this reflects proper mitigation strategies or underreporting.

### Deaths Analysis
From 2010 to 2022, Hepatitis C deaths remained relatively low, with a range from 1 to 21 per month. The data exhibited a pattern of small fluctuations without a clear increasing or decreasing trend. However, starting in mid-2022, there was a distinct rise in death counts, culminating in a peak of 292 in November 2023 â€” a dramatic increase compared to previous counts. This drastic change in fatality suggests a considerable evolution in the virus's impact, increased virulence, or possibly indicates a failure in healthcare provision that needs immediate attention.

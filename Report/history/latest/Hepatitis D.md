## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as Delta Hepatitis, is a serious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis D virus (HDV). It is an RNA virus that requires Hepatitis B (HBV) to replicate, making it unique among human viral diseases. HDV can occur either as a coinfection with HBV or as a superinfection in HBV carriers. It leads to more severe complications than HBV alone, including rapid onset cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis D is less common than other forms of viral hepatitis, but is prevalent in regions where HBV is widespread.
## Highlights

- Gradual decline in reported Hepatitis D cases from 2016 to 2023, with cases peaking in early years (60 cases in January 2016) and significantly reducing to 19 cases by November 2023. <br/>
- No reported deaths from Hepatitis D during the observed period, indicative of either successful case management, low disease fatality, or underreporting of mortality data. <br/>
- Notable decrease in the incidence of cases starting from 2020, which could be attributed to improved public health interventions, changes in reporting, or potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on surveillance activities and healthcare access. <br/>
- Relative stability in the number of cases in the recent years with a range of 10-30 cases per month, suggesting a controlled but persistent presence of the disease in the Chinese mainland population. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hepatitis D cases on the Chinese mainland from January 2016 show a slight decrement trend over 7 years, with initial figures around 60 cases declining to mid-teens by 2023. Monthly case counts display variability but without a clear seasonal pattern. A noticeable dip occurs in 2020, potentially due to heightened infectious disease control measures for COVID-19, which then slightly rebounds in the subsequent years. Despite fluctuations, the data does not indicate any significant outbreak patterns, suggesting effective containment and possibly successful public health interventions over the years.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the 7-year surveillance period, the death count for Hepatitis D in China has remained at zero. This could indicate a strong healthcare response, effective disease management, and possible underreporting or successful avoidance of lethal complications. The consistent lack of fatalities suggests that while infections do occur, the public health system may be well-equipped to treat or manage Hepatitis D cases. Given the potential severity of this disease, the absence of fatalities demands continued vigilance, efficient reporting systems, and sustained preventive measures.

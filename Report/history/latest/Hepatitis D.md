Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends for Hepatitis D cases in mainland China.

To visualize the data, we can create a line graph showing the monthly cases over time. Additionally, we can calculate the average number of cases per month to identify any long-term trends.

Here is the line graph representing the monthly cases of Hepatitis D in mainland China:

From the graph, we can observe the following patterns and trends:

1. Seasonal Patterns: The data shows a recurring pattern of fluctuation in cases each year. We can observe peaks and troughs that seem to occur around the same time each year.

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The peak periods for Hepatitis D cases appear to be in the months of May and November, with the highest number of cases recorded during those months. On the other hand, the trough periods, with the lowest number of cases, occur during the months of February and October.

3. Overall Trend: In terms of the long-term trend, the data suggests that there is no significant increase or decrease in the number of Hepatitis D cases over the analyzed period. The average number of cases per month remains relatively stable, with some variations but no clear upward or downward trend.

It's important to note that the data provided only includes cases until June 2023. Therefore, the analysis and conclusions may change if more recent data becomes available.

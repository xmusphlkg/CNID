## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as delta hepatitis, is a serious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis D Virus (HDV). It is unique among hepatitis viruses as it can only infect individuals already affected by Hepatitis B. HDV can occur either as a simultaneous infection with Hep B (co-infection) or a superinfection in individuals with established Hep B infection. It often results in more severe disease than Hep B alone and is associated with a greater risk of long-term complications like cirrhosis and liver cancer. Transmission routes include percutaneous or mucosal exposure to infectious blood or body fluids.
## Highlights

- Steady decrease in Hepatitis D cases observed from 2016 to 2023, with initial monthly cases around 40-60 in 2016, dropping to 10-20 cases per month by 2022. <br/>
- No reported deaths from Hepatitis D throughout the recorded period, indicating effective case management or low disease fatality. <br/>
- A significant drop in cases occurred in 2020, which may correlate with public health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as lockdowns or increased attention to hygiene. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the disease incidence remains low with 19 cases and zero deaths, suggesting effective control of Hepatitis D in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2016 to November 2023, Chinese mainland reported a decreasing trend in Hepatitis D cases, initiating at 60 cases and maintaining between 10 to 60 cases per month without any drastic spikes. The highest reported cases were in May 2017 and September 2017 with 59 cases each. A sharp decline began in 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic onset, reaching the lowest at 10 cases in October and November 2022. The reduction could be associated with increased public health interventions, including better hygiene practices and possibly reduced reporting due to the overshadowing COVID-19 crisis.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the provided timeframe from 2016 to 2023, there has been a consistent report of zero deaths due to Hepatitis D in Chinese mainland. The absence of reported fatalities may suggest either a high effectiveness of the healthcare system in managing the disease, successful vaccination and treatment strategies, or underreporting of mortality related to Hepatitis D. The data implies a nonfatal course of the disease or potentially effective preventive measures, assuming accurate death surveillance and reporting systems are in place.

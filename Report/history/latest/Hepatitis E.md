## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV). Typically transmitted through fecal-oral routes, such as contaminated water, it often results in acute infections. The disease is prevalent in regions with poor sanitation, particularly in parts of Asia and Africa. While it generally leads to a self-limiting infection, it can be severe in certain populations, such as pregnant women and individuals with pre-existing liver diseases. There are four main genotypes affecting humans with variable epidemiology. No specific treatment exists, and prevention hinges on maintaining quality water supplies and ensuring proper sanitation.

## Highlights

- Hepatitis E cases in mainland China show a cyclical pattern, with peaks often occurring in March, suggesting possible seasonal or behavioural factors. <br/>
- Overall mortality from Hepatitis E remains low, with death rates sporadically distributed across various months without a clear trend. <br/>
- A significant decline in cases and deaths is observed in 2020, possibly due to public health measures for COVID-19, highlighting the impact of interventions beyond their intended target. <br/>
- Since the decrease in 2020, the number of cases has been rising again but remained below pre-2020 levels as of October 2023, indicating a possible stabilization or ongoing control efforts. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to October 2023, mainland China reported increasing trends of Hepatitis E cases with seasonal fluctuations. A visible peak occurs in March annually, suggesting a possible seasonal pattern. Overall, the number of cases appears to rise from 2010 through 2013, with 2011 March reporting the highest number of cases (4262). Thereafter, the cases stabilize with slightly lower peaks, except for a marked dip in 2020, possibly due to public health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent years show a rebound to pre-pandemic levels.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths associated with Hepatitis E from 2010 to 2023 were relatively low, with an overall mortality range of 0-6 deaths per month. The highest mortality was observed in February 2010, March 2010, and December 2017, each recording 6 deaths. However, the mortality rate does not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend. The lack of data for multiple months in 2011 and no apparent association between the number of cases and deaths each month suggests a low fatality rate and potentially varying reporting standards or intervention efficacies across the years.

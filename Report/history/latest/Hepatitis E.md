## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV). This virus is typically transmitted through the fecal-oral route, primarily through contaminated water. The disease is prevalent in many parts of the world, more common in areas with poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water. Symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, loss of appetite, and nausea, but in many cases, it remains asymptomatic. Though generally self-limiting, severe cases can lead to acute liver failure, especially in pregnant women and individuals with pre-existing chronic liver disease.
## Highlights

- Hepatitis E in Chinese mainland exhibits fluctuating case numbers; as of November 2023, there were 2751 cases without fatalities.<br/>
- Mortality has consistently remained low, indicating either a low fatality rate or effective medical interventions.<br/>
- Notably, cases dipped in 2020, potentially due to heightened public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, then rose again.<br/>
- The latest trend showcases stabilizing case numbers with minimal deaths, suggesting efficient disease control as of November 2023.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From November 2013 to November 2023, there is an observable cyclical pattern in the reported cases of Hepatitis E on the Chinese mainland, with peaks generally occurring in the first quarter of each year. A notable reduction in cases is seen in February 2020, possibly due to public health measures for COVID-19 curbing this feco-orally transmitted disease. Despite fluctuations, there is no clear long-term upward or downward trend in incidence, indicating a stable endemicity of Hepatitis E over the observed decade, with yearly case number ranging between 1045 and 3401.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths associated with Hepatitis E over the period of 2013 to 2023 on the Chinese mainland remains consistently low, with monthly fatalities rarely exceeding three. While there are sporadic peaks--the most noticeable being six deaths in December 2017--the overall death toll indicates a low case-fatality rate. The data suggests effective clinical management and possibly a predominance of less virulent viral strains or genotypes. The slight decreasing trend in the latter years could be attributed to improved healthcare interventions or underreporting.

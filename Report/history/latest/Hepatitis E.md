## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver, causing it to inflame and malfunction. Mainly transmitted through fecal-oral route due to poor sanitation, it is caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV). Symptoms may include yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), lack of appetite, and fatigue. While most people recover fully, it may pose severe complications, particularly for pregnant women or individuals with pre-existing chronic liver disease. It predominantly occurs in areas with poor sanitation and typically results in large outbreaks in these regions.
## Highlights

- Hepatitis E cases in the Chinese mainland show seasonal fluctuations with peaks typically occurring in the months of March and April, suggesting a possible seasonal pattern of transmission. <br/>
- Overall, the number of cases has been relatively stable over the years, with an average of approximately 2000-3000 cases per month, indicating a persistent presence of the virus in the population. <br/>
- The mortality rate associated with Hepatitis E remains low, with zero deaths recorded in several months and typically not exceeding three deaths in the months when fatalities were reported. <br/>
- Data for certain months in 2011 are missing, which could indicate reporting issues or a disruption in monitoring; however, there is no immediate evidence suggesting significant changes in disease incidence or mortality following this gap. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Hepatitis E cases in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023 shows seasonal variability with a higher incidence typically observed in March and April, suggesting potential seasonality in transmission. Overall cases have some fluctuation across the years, with a peak between 2011 and 2013. A notable decrease in cases occurred from 2020 February to 2020 December, potentially reflecting impacts of public health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-2020, case counts appear to regain previous levels, highlighting the need for sustained disease surveillance.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths associated with Hepatitis E from January 2010 to November 2023 remained relatively low compared to the case counts, indicating a relatively low case-fatality rate. A maximum of 6 deaths in a single month was observed in February 2010 and December 2017. The deaths did not show a clear seasonal trend and fluctuated minimally over the years. The data does not demonstrate any significant year-to-year upward or downward trends in mortality but does indicate the continuous presence of fatal outcomes, reinforcing the need for effective clinical management and preventive strategies.

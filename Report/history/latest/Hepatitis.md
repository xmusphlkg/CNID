## Introduction

Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver caused primarily by viruses: Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. It can also be induced by other factors like alcohol, drugs, toxins, and certain diseases. Symptoms may include jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain. It can cause both acute and chronic disease, with the latter potentially leading to severe health issues like liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. Prevention involves practices like good hygiene, safe food preparation, and vaccinations for Hepatitis A and B. For Hepatitis C, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.
## Highlights

- Notable rise in Hepatitis cases since 2022, with a significant spike in deaths from 2023 May onward, indicating an increasing fatality rate. <br/>
- The highest number of deaths recorded in November 2023, with 327 fatalities despite advances in health measures and vaccination efforts. <br/>
- The pattern suggests a possible outbreak or the emergence of a more virulent strain requiring urgent public health attention and resources. <br/>
- Cases in November 2023 (156,977) far exceed the average over the previous years, emphasizing the need for enhanced surveillance and intervention strategies. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, there is a general fluctuation in hepatitis cases reported in Chinese mainland with peaks typically observed in March, July, or August of each year. The highest recorded cases are in August 2023 (166,606), while the lowest are in December 2022 (72,630). Notably, there's a sharp decline in cases in early 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by a return to pre-pandemic levels thereafter. The data also reflects sporadic months with anomalously low reporting, which could indicate underreporting or data collection issues.

### Deaths Analysis
Death counts exhibit greater stability compared to case counts, with values generally ranging from 25 to 100 from 2010 to early 2023. However, starting in May 2023, there is an alarming increase in reported deaths, peaking in November 2023 with 327 fatalities. This concerning upsurge suggests a change in either the pathogenicity of the hepatitis virus, healthcare system capacity, or reporting accuracy. Further investigation is needed to understand the cause behind this rise and to implement appropriate public health interventions.

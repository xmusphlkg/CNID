## Introduction

Hepatitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the liver, generally caused by viral infections. The five main hepatitis viruses are A, B, C, D, and E, differing in modes of transmission, severity, geographical distribution, and prevention methods. Hepatitis can also result from alcohol, toxins, or some medications. Chronic types like Hepatitis B or C can lead to severe health issues like liver cirrhosis or cancer. Vaccination and proper hygiene can prevent some forms of hepatitis.

## Highlights

- A marked increase in Hepatitis cases in November 2023 (156,977 cases) compared to the same period in the previous year. <br/>
- November 2023 saw the highest reported deaths (327 deaths) at any point in the provided data, indicating rising case fatality. <br/>
- Since May 2023, there has been a sustained increase in both cases and deaths, suggesting a potential outbreak. <br/>
- The mortality rate peak in November 2023 suggests a heightened severity or change in viral patterns necessitating urgent health interventions.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, monthly hepatitis cases in China's mainland showed fluctuations with peaks often in March (avg. ~140,000 cases), indicating possible seasonal patterns. The lowest number of cases (~72,630) was reported in December 2022, suggesting a decline or reporting anomaly. However, cases rose to a high of 166,606 by August 2023, implying a significant increase or improved case detection. Overall, the data denotes variability with a potential increase in cases over the analyzed period.

### Deaths Analysis
Hepatitis-related deaths revealed an irregular pattern with an average of <100 deaths/month until a discernible escalation starting April 2023. Prior spikes in deaths (January 2020) were relatively modest. The data shows a drastic rise in fatalities in May 2023 (170 deaths), with the highest of 327 deaths in November 2023. This surge could indicate a change in virulence, reporting practices, healthcare strain, or co-factors such as co-infections or access to care. The precise cause of the mortality increase necessitates further epidemiological investigation.

## Introduction

Hepatitis is a medical condition characterized by the inflammation of the liver, mainly caused by viral infections. The five major types are Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, each caused by a different virus. Hepatitis can manifest as either acute, with quick onset and potential recovery, or chronic, lasting many years and leading to serious health problems such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Vaccinations are available for some types. Non-viral causes include alcohol abuse, certain medications, and autoimmune diseases.


## Highlights

1. Sustained Epidemic: Despite fluctuations, a consistent level of Hepatitis cases is observed throughout these years in Mainland China, indicating the presence of a sustained epidemic. <br/>
2. Rising Mortality: The mortality rate significantly escalated in 2023, with November reporting the highest number of deaths so far (327), indicating a worsening situation. <br/>
3. Short-Term Spikes: Notable short-term spikes occurred in the number of cases, such as February and August 2023, requiring immediate attention and targeted interventions. <br/>
4. 2022 Decline: Interestingly, a considerable decline was observed in December 2022, however, case counts rose again in 2023.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The hepatitis data spanning from 2010 to 2023 for mainland China reveals a relatively stable trend in the number of reported cases. There are typically around 100,000 to 150,000 cases each month. However, distinct rises and falls are observed around specific months, particularly peaks in March and a slight dip in February, hinting at possible seasonal patterns. More pronounced year-to-year trends are subtle due to closely packed data points, yet a mild decrease in case numbers is evident from 2010 to 2015, contrasted by subsequent relatively stable years with a surge in 2023 that implies a possible health crisis.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported death counts associated with Hepatitis in mainland China are overall relatively low compared to the case counts, indicating effective treatment or mild disease forms. The death counts demonstrate little variation from 2010 to 2022, averaging around 50-80 deaths per month. Intriguingly, in 2023, there is a sharp upsurge in deaths, with counts escalating into the hundreds, climaxing at 327 deaths in November. This rise suggests a grave change in disease severity, healthcare system gaps, or reporting practices that deserve urgent public health attention, considering the previous stability of fatality figures.

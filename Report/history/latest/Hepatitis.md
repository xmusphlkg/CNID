## Introduction

Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, commonly caused by a viral infection, but there are other possible causes such as toxic substances and autoimmune diseases. The five main strains of hepatitis viruses are types A, B, C, D, and E. These types vary in prevalence, mode of transmission, geographic distribution, and health impacts. Symptoms may include jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Some hepatitis infections resolve spontaneously, while others can lead to chronic disease, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Prevention and treatment depend on the type of hepatitis and may involve vaccines, antiviral drugs, or other strategies.

## Highlights

- Steady increase in Hepatitis cases observed since the beginning of 2023, indicating a significant rising trend that warrants further investigation and public health response. <br/>
- Notably high mortality rates recorded in October 2023 (257 deaths), suggesting either an enhanced virulence of the pathogen or possibly an outbreak of a more lethal strain or subtype. <br/>
- The Hepatitis death count has escalated sharply in recent months (since May 2023), marking a departure from relatively stable mortality seen in previous years, highlighting the need for urgent epidemiological studies. <br/>
- The sharp rise in cases and deaths, specifically from May to October 2023, demands immediate strengthening of surveillance, vaccination campaigns, and healthcare interventions targeting Hepatitis in mainland China. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to October 2023, reported cases of hepatitis in mainland China have exhibited fluctuations without a clear increasing or decreasing trend. Monthly cases initially ranged between 92,978 and 157,711, with occasional peaks suggesting potential outbreaks or enhanced detection efforts. A notable decrease occurred in December 2022, with 72,630 casesâ€”the lowest in the observed period. However, cases surged in the final year, reaching a high of 166,606 in August 2023. This recent increase might indicate a significant outbreak or changes in surveillance/reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
The hepatitis-associated deaths fluctuated modestly from 2010 to early 2023, typically ranging from 25 to 100 monthly deaths. However, a stark escalation in fatalities was observed, starting in May 2023, with deaths rising sharply to a peak of 257 in October 2023. This increase in mortality rate could point to the emergence of a more virulent hepatitis strain, a larger outbreak overwhelming healthcare resources, reduced access to medical care, or potential co-infections exacerbating disease severity. Further investigation is warranted to understand and combat this trend.

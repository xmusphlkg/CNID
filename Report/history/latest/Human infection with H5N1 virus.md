## Introduction

Human infection with H5N1 virus, commonly referred to as avian influenza or "bird flu," is a highly pathogenic strain that originated from birds. The virus is zoonotic, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans, often through direct contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human cases remain rare, but are frequently severe or fatal. Symptoms may mimic the common flu - fever, cough, sore throat - but can advance to severe respiratory illness. The potential mutation of this virus is a global public health concern due to its potential to spark a pandemic.
## Highlights

- Occasional H5N1 infections were observed, with a notable absence of cases for extended periods, suggesting sporadic transmission rather than sustained human-to-human spread. <br/>
- The mortality rate among confirmed cases fluctuated, indicating variation in the virus's lethality or differences in the management of infected patients across the analyzed timeframe. <br/>
- The data reflect no significant seasonal pattern, with cases occurring in different months without a clear trend towards winter or any other season. <br/>
- The most recent data up to November 2023 show no current cases, suggesting successful control measures or low virus circulation among humans. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between November 2013 and April 2023, the Chinese mainland reported a total of 11 human H5N1 infection cases scattered across multiple years with inconsistent occurrences. The earliest cases were seen in February 2014, while the latest case was reported in February 2023. The year with the most cases was 2015 with seven cases. Interestingly, there have been multiple years without any reported cases, indicating sporadic transmission or potentially underreporting.

### Deaths Analysis
During the same time frame, H5N1 resulted in 7 reported deaths. Despite low case numbers, the mortality rate among reported cases is high, with deaths occurring in each year where more than one case was reported except for February 2014. The death in May 2015 is noteworthy as it occurred without new cases reported that month, suggesting a delayed fatal outcome from a previous infection or a reporting lag.

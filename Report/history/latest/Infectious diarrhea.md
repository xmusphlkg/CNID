## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea is a common health issue primarily caused by viral, bacterial or parasitic infections. This condition typically results from poor hygiene or consuming contaminated food or water, especially in developing countries. Symptoms often include frequent, loose, watery stools, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Persistent cases can lead to dehydration, malabsorption and a disturbed gut flora, posing a significant health risk. Preventative measures include improved sanitation, safe food handling, and vaccination efforts for specific disease agents.
## Highlights

- A significant decrease in infectious diarrhea cases and deaths is observed in November 2023 (73,835 cases, 0 deaths), compared to the peak values observed in previous years. <br/>
- There is a consistent pattern of seasonality with case numbers generally increasing in the summer months (June to August) and declining towards the end of the year. <br/>
- The fatality rate of infectious diarrhea in China has markedly declined, reaching zero deaths from January 2023 to November 2023, indicating improved management and possible advancements in public health interventions. <br/>
- There was an evident drop in cases in December 2022, which has since then partially rebounded, yet the figures for November 2023 remain substantially lower than those seen in the same month of previous years.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the years 2010-2023, the Chinese mainland has experienced periodic fluctuations in infectious diarrhea cases with noticeable peaks during the summer months, particularly July and August. Cases generally increase from May to August, suggesting a seasonal pattern, potentially associated with factors such as temperature and hygiene practices. The highest recorded cases occur from 2017 onwards, exceeding 100,000 cases frequently. A sharp decline is observed in December 2022, but case numbers have since been on the rise, potentially indicating a new wave of infections into 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to infectious diarrhea in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 have remained low relative to the number of cases, with monthly fatalities rarely exceeding five. An overall low fatality rate is observed, with no deaths reported in many of the months from 2020 onwards. This may suggest improvements in healthcare access, treatment efficacy, or disease surveillance and response. There is no clear seasonal trend observable in the number of deaths, and the highest number recorded in a single month is seven, which occurred sporadically over the observed period.

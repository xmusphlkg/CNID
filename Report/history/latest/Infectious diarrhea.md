## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea, prevalent globally, is primarily caused by a host of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, or parasites that invade the gastrointestinal tract. These pathogens are commonly transmitted through contaminated water, food, or close contact with infected persons. Major symptoms involve frequent loose, watery stools, dehydration, and abdominal cramps. The impact ranges from mild, self-limited conditions to severe, potentially life-threatening illnesses. It is a significant public health issue, particularly in developing countries where it contributes to considerable morbidity and mortality. The control and prevention strategies focus on hygiene education, provision of clean water, and vaccination, where available.
## Highlights

- There is an evident seasonal trend with peaks generally in the winter (January) and summer (July-August), suggesting possible seasonal influences on transmission. <br/>
- A marked reduction in the number of cases is observed after December 2022, which continues into November 2023, indicating a possible improvement in preventative measures or reporting changes. <br/>
- Since February 2020, the fatality associated with infectious diarrhea is consistently low, with many months reporting zero deaths, suggesting improved clinical management and possibly better overall health infrastructure. <br/>
- The consistent decrease in both cases and deaths from 2020 onward could indicate effective intervention strategies, possibly including widespread health education, improved sanitation, and prompt healthcare access. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Infectious diarrhea cases in the Chinese mainland have seasonal fluctuations, with the highest numbers typically seen in winter and summer. Cases peaked significantly in January 2018 (186,071 cases) and showed a notable drop in February 2020 (45,510 cases), potentially due to public health interventions or reporting discrepancies during the COVID-19 pandemic onset. A general downward trend is observed afterward, culminating in a steep decline by December 2022 (29,010 cases).

### Deaths Analysis
Overall mortality associated with infectious diarrhea across the years remains low, with a maximum of seven deaths in July 2014. Remarkably, since the beginning of 2021, fatalities have become even less frequent, with most months reporting zero deaths. This improvement could be attributed to advances in medical care, better disease surveillance, and interventions. The data indicate effective control of fatalities due to infectious diarrhea in recent years.

## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea is a condition characterized by the frequent passage of loose, watery stools resulting from the infection of the gastrointestinal tract by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Common etiological agents include Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Rotavirus, and Giardia lamblia. Transmission often occurs via consumption of contaminated food or water or through person-to-person contact. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to severe dehydration, potentially necessitating medical treatment. Prevention strategies focus on sanitation, food safety, and vaccination for certain pathogens.

## Highlights

- Cases of infectious diarrhea in mainland China have displayed recurring seasonality, with peaks frequently occurring in the summer months (June to August) and a noticeable decrease towards winter. <br/>
- The overall trend from 2010 to 2023 indicates an increase in the number of cases, with a significant rise observed from 2017 onwards. <br/>
- Comparatively lower case counts were noted in 2020 during February and March, potentially due to stringent public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, resuming to prior trends in subsequent months. <br/>
- Remarkably, the mortality associated with infectious diarrhea has decreased over time, with no deaths reported from March 2021 onward despite the increased number of cases. This could be indicative of improvements in medical care, public health interventions, or reporting practices. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicates a progressive increase in infectious diarrhea cases in China between January 2010 and October 2023, with seasonal peaks typically observed in the warmer months (May to September). This seasonal pattern may be attributed to factors such as temperature and humidity, which can affect the transmission of causative pathogens. Notably, there are anomalies in reporting with missing data in early 2013 and a significant spike in cases beginning in 2017, with the highest count in December 2017 (174,969). Of interest is the drop in February 2020, possibly associated with public health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to infectious diarrhea in China from January 2010 to October 2023 was low relative to the number of cases, with no fatalities reported after February 2023. Peak mortalities are sporadic, with no clear seasonal trend. The highest reported deaths in a single month were 7 (July 2014). The mortality data suggests effective case management and control measures, given the low fatality rates despite high morbidity in certain periods. The zero fatalities reported from March 2023 onwards could reflect improvements in prevention, reporting fidelity, or healthcare interventions.

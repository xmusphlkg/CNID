## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea, primarily caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites, is a prevalent global health concern, characterized by abnormally frequent and liquid bowel movements. It gets transmitted through contaminated food, water, or person-to-person contact. Symptoms include abdominal cramps, fever, and dehydration. High-risk groups include children, elderly, people with weakened immune systems, and travelers to areas with poor sanitation. Significant parts of global morbidity and mortality, especially among children in developing countries, can be attributed to infectious diarrhea.
## Highlights

- The pattern shows peaks in warmer months (May-August) but a significant drop in cases from December 2022, continuing into 2023. <br/>
- November 2023 recorded just 73,835 cases, a sharp decrease compared to the highs of previous years. <br/>
- No deaths from infectious diarrhea reported from January to November 2023, suggesting improved disease management or reporting accuracy. <br/>
- A long-term decline in mortality is evident, with fatalities reducing to zero in 2023, indicative of effective treatment or prevention methods. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for infectious diarrhea in China from 2010 to 2023 show seasonal fluctuation with peaks in summer months (June, July, and August), possibly due to temperature and humidity favoring pathogen proliferation. A gradual increase in reported cases over the years is observed, with significant spikes occurring; for instance, January 2018 reached a high of 186,071 cases. Reduction in case numbers occurs in winter months, and an atypical drop in February 2020 coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting possible underreporting or reduced transmission due to lockdowns and increased hygiene measures.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality associated with infectious diarrhea in China from 2010 to 2023 remained low, with deaths per month rarely exceeding 5 and often at 0 or 1. The data exhibit no clear seasonal pattern in fatalities and indicate that the conditionâ€™s fatality rate is low. Notably, from 2020 onwards, no deaths were reported in several months, which might be attributed to improved medical care, heightened awareness, or underreporting. The limited mortality amidst rising case numbers suggests effective management in preventing severe outcomes of infectious diarrhea cases.

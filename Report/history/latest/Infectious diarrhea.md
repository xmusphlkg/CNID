Thank you for providing the data. Let's begin by analyzing the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends in the monthly cases and deaths of infectious diarrhea in mainland China.

First, let's visualize the overall trend of cases and deaths over time.

From the graph, we can see that the number of cases and deaths of infectious diarrhea generally increased from 2010 to 2017, with some fluctuations along the way. After 2017, there seems to be a decline in cases and deaths.

To better understand the seasonal patterns, let's analyze the data on a monthly basis.

From the monthly cases graph, we observe that there is a recurring pattern of peaks and troughs throughout the years. The number of cases tends to rise starting from January, reaching a peak around July or August, and then gradually decreasing towards the end of the year.

Now, let's analyze the monthly deaths.

The monthly deaths graph shows a similar pattern to the cases graph, with peaks and troughs occurring in a similar fashion. However, it is important to note that the number of deaths is generally lower compared to the number of cases.

In summary, the analysis of the data reveals the following patterns and trends:
- There is an overall increasing trend in cases and deaths of infectious diarrhea from 2010 to 2017, followed by a decline after 2017.
- Both cases and deaths exhibit seasonal patterns, with peaks occurring around July or August and troughs towards the end of the year.
- The number of deaths is generally lower compared to the number of cases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided data. Further analysis and interpretation can be conducted by considering additional factors such as population demographics, environmental factors, and public health interventions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiological trends and patterns of infectious diarrhea in mainland China.

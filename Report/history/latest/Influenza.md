## Introduction

Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. There are four types: A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are responsible for seasonal outbreaks mainly occurring in the winter season. Symptoms range from mild to severe and can lead to serious complications in vulnerable populations. Vaccines are available and modified annually to counteract the most common circulating strains. Despite this, millions of people worldwide contract influenza each year, emphasizing its significant public health impact.

## Highlights

1. Influenza incidence witnessed a dramatic surge in March 2023, with 3721370 reported cases, indicating a sudden outbreak. <br/>
2. The fatality rate remains extremely low despite the significant increase in cases, suggesting that the current strain might be highly transmissible but less lethal. <br/>
3. The November 2023 data reveals a current high, with 1862998 cases, but fewer deaths (1), further reinforcing the above observations. <br/>
4. Analyzing the data from 2010, there's an overall increasing trend in reported cases, warranting enhanced influenza surveillance and control measures. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

An increasing trend over time is noted from the reported influenza cases in mainland China. Early years display fewer numbers, generally ranging in the thousands. However, from 2018, a considerable growth is observed, reaching over 600,000 cases in January 2019. Numbers peak in December 2019, almost hitting 1.2 million. Fluctuations persist, but a substantial surge occurs in March 2023 with an unprecedented ~3.7 million cases. Seasonal peaks around December-January and troughs around summer suggests the influence of weather changes on virus transmission rates in this region.

### Deaths Analysis

Overall, the death count remains relatively low despite the increasing case numbers. The data shows sporadic months with no reported deaths, such as March 2011, despite thousands of cases. A noticeable increase in the deaths appears in January 2018 with 56 fatalities, but they remain under 150 even with the million-case surge in 2019. Particularly in March 2023, where the cases skyrocket to around 3.7 million, the death toll rises only marginally to 38. Such low fatality rates, despite a high case load, may reflect healthcare access and service quality, alongside the typically modest mortality of influenza.

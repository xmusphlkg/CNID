Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends for Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China.

First, let's plot the monthly cases over time:

From the graph, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Seasonality: Japanese encephalitis cases show a clear seasonality, with higher numbers during the summer and early autumn months (June to October) and lower numbers during the rest of the year.

2. Peaks: The highest peaks in cases occur in August, followed by July and September. These months consistently have the highest number of cases throughout the years.

3. Troughs: The lowest number of cases is typically observed in the winter months (December to February), with February having the lowest number of cases.

Next, let's examine the overall trend of Japanese encephalitis cases over the years. To do this, we'll calculate the annual average of monthly cases:

From the annual average cases graph, we can observe the following trends:

1. Overall Increase: There is an increasing trend in Japanese encephalitis cases from 2010 to around 2018. After 2018, the number of cases starts to decline.

2. Peak in 2010: The year 2010 had the highest number of cases, with a sharp increase from the previous years.

3. Fluctuations: While there is an increasing trend in the early years, there are fluctuations in the number of cases from year to year. These fluctuations may be influenced by various factors such as vaccination campaigns, public health interventions, and changes in environmental conditions.

Now, let's analyze the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends for Japanese encephalitis deaths in mainland China.

First, let's plot the monthly deaths over time:

From the graph, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Seasonality: Similar to the cases, Japanese encephalitis deaths also show a clear seasonality, with higher numbers during the summer and early autumn months (June to October) and lower numbers during the rest of the year.

2. Peaks: The highest peaks in deaths occur in August, followed by July and September. These months consistently have the highest number of deaths throughout the years.

3. Troughs: The lowest number of deaths is typically observed in the winter months (December to February), with February having the lowest number of deaths.

Next, let's examine the overall trend of Japanese encephalitis deaths over the years. To do this, we'll calculate the annual average of monthly deaths:

From the annual average deaths graph, we can observe the following trends:

1. Overall Decrease: Similar to the cases, there is a decreasing trend in Japanese encephalitis deaths from 2010 to around 2018. After 2018, the number of deaths remains relatively stable.

2. Peak in 2010: The year 2010 had the highest number of deaths, with a sharp increase from the previous years.

3. Fluctuations: Similar to cases, there are fluctuations in the number of deaths from year to year, potentially influenced by various factors.

In summary, Japanese encephalitis cases and deaths in mainland China exhibit clear seasonal patterns, with higher numbers during the summer and early autumn months. The peak periods for both cases and deaths are observed in August, followed by July and September. While there was an overall increase in cases and deaths from 2010 to around 2018, the numbers have started to decline in recent years. However, fluctuations in the number of cases and deaths are still observed from year to year.

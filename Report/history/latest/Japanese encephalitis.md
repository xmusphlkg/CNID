Seasonal Patterns: Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, characterized by a peak in activity during the summer months and reduced activity in the winter months. The number of cases starts to rise in May, reaches its peak in August, and gradually declines until December. From January to April, the number of cases remains generally low.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China occurs in July and August. During these months, there is a significant increase in the number of cases, with July reporting the highest number of cases. The trough period for cases takes place from January to April, during which the number of cases is comparatively low compared to the rest of the year.

Overall Trends: Generally, the number of Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China has displayed fluctuations over the years. There is variation in the number of cases from year to year, with certain years witnessing higher or lower numbers of cases. Nevertheless, there is a noticeable upward trend in recent years, peaking in 2011, 2012, and 2017. Following 2017, there has been a gradual decline in the number of cases.

Discussion: The seasonal patterns observed for Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China align with the known biology and transmission dynamics of the disease. The primary mode of transmission is through mosquito bites, and the heightened mosquito activity during the warm summer months likely contributes to the increased number of cases during this time. The trough period from January to April can be attributed to reduced mosquito activity and diminished transmission.

The concerning trend of increasing cases in recent years could be influenced by various factors. Changes in climate and land usage, as well as population movement and urbanization, may contribute to the spread and persistence of the disease. Mitigation efforts, such as mosquito population control measures and vaccination administration, can help alleviate the impact of Japanese encephalitis in mainland China.

Close monitoring of the epidemiological patterns of Japanese encephalitis by public health authorities is crucial. Implementation of targeted interventions, including the promotion of mosquito control measures, ensuring access to vaccinations, and public education on prevention strategies, is essential in reducing the disease burden. Moreover, continuous surveillance and research on the factors influencing virus transmission and spread are critical for effective prevention and control efforts.

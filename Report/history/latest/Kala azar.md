## Introduction

Kala Azar, also known as Visceral Leishmaniasis, is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of infected sand flies. It affects the vital organs, predominantly the spleen and liver, leading to fever, weight loss, anemia, and an enlarged liver and spleen. If untreated, Kala Azar can be fatal. The disease primarily occurs in the Indian subcontinent, East Africa, and Brazil. Effective diagnosis and treatment methods are available, but access to them can be challenging in endemic areas. Preventive measures focus on controlling the sand fly population and minimizing human contact.
## Highlights

- Kala azar cases in the Chinese mainland have remained relatively low and stable over the years, with an average of 25 cases per month. <br/>
- Occasional spikes in cases are observed, the highest being 123 in November 2015, followed by a period of decreasing monthly case counts. <br/>
- Mortality due to Kala azar is very uncommon with few reported deaths, indicating potentially effective treatment and control measures in place. <br/>
- The most recent data from November 2023 shows 19 cases and no deaths, consistent with the overall trend of low case counts and mortality associated with Kala azar in the region.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Kala azar cases in the Chinese mainland have shown fluctuations from 2010 to 2023, ranging typically between 10 and 60 cases per month with occasional peaks. Notably, an upward trend is observed in late 2014 and late 2015, with cases spiking to 113 in October 2015. More recently, monthly cases have typically remained below 40, except for an increase to 37 in March 2023. The data indicates sporadic transmission without significant seasonal trends, suggesting localized outbreaks or variable reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to Kala azar in the Chinese mainland are rare, with most months reporting zero fatalities from 2010 to 2023. In total, there are 8 recorded deaths over this period. The few instances of mortality (2010 March, 2012 October, 2013 March, 2014 May, 2016 February, 2020 November, 2022 February, 2023 April, and 2023 August) do not display a clear seasonal pattern or correlation with peaks in case numbers, implying effective case management and treatment, low virulence, or underreporting of deaths.

## Introduction

Kala azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bites of infected sandflies. It typically manifests with irregular bouts of fever, significant weight loss, swelling of the spleen and liver, and anemia. If left untreated, it can lead to severe complications, impairing critical organs and potentially causing death. It's prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly poorest areas and marginalized communities. It's estimated that 50,000 to 90,000 new cases occur worldwide each year.


## Highlights

1. Overall case decline: The total cases of Kala azar in mainland China exhibited a generalized downward trend from 2010 to 2023, from a peak of 53 cases in January 2010 to a lower count of 19 cases in November 2023. <br/>
2. Seasonal pattern: Disease incidence typically peaked in the spring (March to May) and ebbed in the late summer and winter months, suggesting a possible seasonal pattern. <br/>
3. Mortality rate: The mortality rate remained generally low over the years, however, a small upward trend was noted in 2023 with several months reporting one death. <br/>
4. Recent stabilization: Since 2022, there appears to be a stabilization of new cases counting between 9 and 37 cases each month, with a slight uptick in deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Cases of Kala Azar in mainland China were highest from late 2010 to early 2011, and thereafter exhibited a cyclical pattern with a gradual decline overall until late 2015, where an abrupt surge was experienced. The subsequent years (2016-2021) were marked by a sustained reduction in cases with intermittent fluctuations. In 2022, cases briefly increased, but ultimately began decreasing again. Through 2023, case numbers slightly rose but remained relatively stable. Major factors contributing to the distribution trend could be seasonal changes in vector populations and public health efforts to control the disease.

### Deaths Analysis
Kala Azar-related deaths in mainland China were reasonably low given the total case count. The deaths occurred sporadically throughout the observed period, with no discernible pattern, and the fatality rate remained exceedingly low compared to the incidence rate. The reasons behind the low fatality could be early detection and appropriate treatment of the disease due to effective surveillance systems or overall disease awareness. The data shows that there is no direct correlation between the number of cases reported each month/year and the death toll due to the disease in mainland China.

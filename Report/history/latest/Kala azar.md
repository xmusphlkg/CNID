## Introduction

Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is a life-threatening disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. It is transmitted through the bites of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. The disease primarily affects the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, leading to fever, weight loss, anemia, and enlargement of the spleen and liver. If untreated, it has a high fatality rate. Kala-azar is endemic in regions of Asia, East Africa, South America, and the Mediterranean basin. Treatment includes antimonial compounds, amphotericin B, miltefosine, and other antiparasitic drugs.

## Highlights

- A gradual decline in Kala azar cases from 2010 to 2023, with intermittent peaks suggesting episodic outbreaks. <br/>
- Low mortality overall, with occasional deaths suggesting the potential for fatal outcomes, highlighting the need for continued surveillance and healthcare response. <br/>
- A notable increase in cases from July to October 2023, with 30 cases in July, a slight decrease to 26 in August and September, and 19 in October, indicating a recent spike that warrants investigation. <br/>
- The persistent presence of Kala azar cases in mainland China over the 2010-2023 period underlines the endemic nature of the disease, with implications for both public health planning and long-term prevention strategies. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to October 2023, mainland China reported 3,792 cases of Kala azar with fluctuations over the years. Cases peaked at 123 in November 2015 before generally trending downward. Notably, seasonal patterns emerge, with higher incidences typically in the latter half of the year, potentially associated with vector population cycles. The data for January and February 2013 is missing, which could affect interpretability. Despite some year-to-year variation, there is an overall decline in cases, particularly notable after 2015 with sporadic upsurges.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, there were 10 reported deaths among the Kala azar cases in mainland China. The fatality rate remained low, with deaths occurring sporadically rather than annually (years 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020, 2022, 2023). As such, no discernible pattern or trend in deaths is evident, and the fatality rate is too low to extrapolate seasonality or other demographic factors definitively influencing mortality. The data reflects successful case management and possibly effective control measures leading to low mortality despite the presence of the disease. 

(Note: The analysis does not include a full assessment of the impact of potential under-reporting, misdiagnosis, or other surveillance artifacts that might affect the accuracy of the reported data.)

Seasonal Patterns: Kala azar cases in mainland China exhibit a consistent peak from October to December, followed by a decline from January to March. This pattern recurs with variations throughout the years, with the highest number of cases occurring in October and the lowest in January.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Kala azar cases in mainland China is observed in October, with an average of 45 reported cases. This is followed by a trough period in January, where the average number of cases decreases to 16. These peak and trough periods indicate a seasonal fluctuation in Kala azar cases, with higher transmission during colder months.

Overall Trends: Overall, there is a slight decreasing trend in Kala azar cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023, except for a sharp increase in 2015. The number of cases ranged from as few as 9 in 2012 to as many as 123 in 2015. After 2015, there is a general decline in cases, with some fluctuations in the number of reported cases over the years.

Discussion: The observed seasonal patterns in Kala azar cases in mainland China suggest a cyclical trend with a peak in the winter months, aligning with the known transmission dynamics of the disease. The lower number of cases during the summer months may be attributed to factors such as vector activity, environmental conditions, or human interventions. The overall decreasing trend in Kala azar cases is promising and may indicate successful control efforts implemented in recent years. However, the occasional sharp increases in certain years, such as 2015, emphasize the necessity for continued surveillance and control measures to prevent outbreaks and sustain the declining trend in cases.

Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends for leprosy cases in mainland China.

First, let's visualize the monthly leprosy cases over time:

From the graph, we can observe the following:

1. Seasonal Patterns: There appears to be a recurring pattern of fluctuation in leprosy cases throughout the years. There are certain months where the number of cases is consistently higher or lower compared to other months.

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The highest peak in leprosy cases occurred in June 2011, with 117 cases reported. The lowest trough period was observed in February 2015 and February 2016, with 26 and 21 cases respectively.

3. Overall Trends: Looking at the overall trend, there seems to be a slight decrease in leprosy cases over the years, particularly from 2011 to 2014. However, the number of cases remains relatively stable from 2014 onwards, with some fluctuations.

Now let's analyze the monthly leprosy deaths over time:

Here are some observations:

1. Seasonal Patterns: Similar to leprosy cases, there seems to be a seasonal pattern in leprosy deaths. The number of deaths tends to fluctuate over the months, although the fluctuations are generally smaller compared to the cases.

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The highest peak in leprosy deaths occurred in March 2013, with 1 death reported. There are several months with no reported deaths, indicating trough periods.

3. Overall Trends: Overall, the number of leprosy deaths remains relatively low throughout the years, with occasional spikes in certain months.

In summary, the analysis of the data suggests the presence of seasonal patterns and fluctuations in leprosy cases and deaths in mainland China. The number of cases peaked in June 2011, while the number of deaths peaked in March 2013. However, since 2014, the number of cases and deaths has remained relatively stable, with some fluctuations.

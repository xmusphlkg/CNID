## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansenâ€™s disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and eyes. Leprosy is known for its potential to cause progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes if untreated. Transmission is thought to occur through respiratory droplets from those with untreated, severe forms of the disease. It has a long incubation period, typically 5 years, and is treatable with a combination of antibiotics known as multidrug therapy.

## Highlights

- A notable declining trend in the number of Leprosy cases in mainland China from January 2010 (72 cases) to October 2023 (24 cases), indicating a positive epidemiological control over the years.<br/>
- Deaths due to Leprosy have remained extremely low throughout the observation period, with several months reporting zero deaths, underscoring a possibly effective case management and treatment protocols.<br/>
- Spikes are observed intermittently (e.g., March 2012 with 127 cases), suggesting potential seasonal patterns or localized outbreaks that warrant further investigation for targeted interventions.<br/>
- Recent years from 2019 to 2023 have consistently seen lower case numbers, with no month exceeding 66 cases, indicating sustained efforts in disease reduction and ongoing suppression of transmission within the population.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to October 2023, mainland China reported a total of 4,218 cases of leprosy with some fluctuations. The highest number of cases reported in a single month was 127 in March 2012. The data suggests a mild seasonal pattern with higher cases often in the spring and summer months. Over the observed period, there is a general decline in the number of reported cases per year, indicating the progress in disease control and public health interventions aimed at reducing leprosy incidence.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the same period, leprosy resulted in a total of 10 reported deaths, indicating a relatively low mortality rate compared to the total number of cases. Deaths were sporadic with no apparent pattern over the months and years. The low number of deaths can be attributed to effective treatment options, early diagnosis, and improved healthcare systems. The data does not show an increase in lethality, reinforcing leprosy's status as a manageable infectious disease when adequately addressed.

## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira. It primarily affects animals, but humans can contract the disease through contact with urine from infected animals or a contaminated environment. The infection may result in mild flu-like symptoms, severe symptoms like kidney damage, liver failure, or even death. The prevalence of Leptospirosis varies globally, with frequent occurrences in tropical and subtropical regions due to favorable conditions for Leptospira survival.
## Highlights

1. The yearly incidence of Leptospirosis shows a seasonal pattern with a spike in cases during the summer months and early autumn (June to October).<br/>
2. The death count remained relatively low over the years with an occasional increase during autumn months, suggesting that while more people contract the disease during this period, the resulting mortality rate is relatively marginal.<br/>
3. In recent years (2021-2023), there is a slightly increasing trend in Leptospirosis cases, though the number of deaths has remained steady.<br/>
4. As of November 2023, the situation remains consistent with previous years, with a decline in cases expected in the following months due to seasonal trends.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Leptospirosis case data from mainland China shows distinct seasonality, with cases peaking annually during the late Summer and Autumn months (August to October), indicating a potential linkage with agricultural activities and/or favorable environmental conditions. From 2010, while the overall cases fluctuated year by year, there seems to be a decreasing trend towards 2023, showing notable strides in public health intervention. Notable spikes occurred in 2010 and 2012 - further investigation is warranted to understand these anomalies.

### Deaths Analysis
Death rates have remained consistently low, the highest number occurring in September 2020 with seven fatalities. There appears to be a loose correlation between case numbers and death figures, with the annual pattern of potential fatalities also following the late Summer to Autumn prevalence. This suggests efficient medical intervention. However, the death occurrence in months like February 2011, despite lower case incidents, indicates the disease's unpredictability and the need for continued surveillance and healthcare resource allocation.

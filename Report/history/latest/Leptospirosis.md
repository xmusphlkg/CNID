Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by visualizing the monthly cases and deaths of Leptospirosis in mainland China before June 2023.

First, let's plot the monthly cases:

From the chart, we can observe several patterns and trends in the data:

1. Seasonal Patterns: There is a clear seasonality in the number of Leptospirosis cases. The highest number of cases typically occurs during the summer months (June to August) and early autumn (September). The number of cases starts to increase from May, peaks in August or September, and then gradually decreases towards the end of the year.

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Leptospirosis cases is observed in August, with a significant increase from July. The trough period occurs in the winter months (December to February), where the number of cases is relatively low.

3. Overall Trend: Looking at the overall trend, there is a general increase in the number of cases over the years, with some fluctuations. The number of cases reached its highest point in 2021, followed by a slight decline in 2022 and 2023 (before June). However, it's important to note that the data for 2023 is incomplete, and the trend may change with more data.

Now, let's plot the monthly deaths:

From the chart, we can observe the following:

1. Seasonal Patterns: Similar to the cases, there is a seasonal pattern in the number of deaths, with the highest numbers occurring during the summer months and early autumn.

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for deaths aligns with the peak period of cases, with the highest number of deaths occurring in August or September. The trough period is observed in the winter months, where the number of deaths is relatively low.

3. Overall Trend: The overall trend in deaths follows a similar pattern to the cases, with an increase over the years, reaching a peak in 2021. However, it's important to note that the number of deaths is generally lower compared to the number of cases.

In summary, Leptospirosis cases in mainland China show clear seasonal patterns, with peak periods in the summer and early autumn. There has been an overall increase in the number of cases over the years, with some fluctuations. The number of deaths follows a similar pattern but is generally lower compared to the number of cases.

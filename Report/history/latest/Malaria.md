## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It's a preventable and treatable condition that predominantly affects the poorest regions of the world, with Sub-Saharan Africa bearing the highest burden. The disease manifests with fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms. If not treated promptly with the right antimalarial drugs, malaria can progress to severe illness and often result in death. The global fight against malaria involves vector control strategies, vaccines, antimalarial medications, and measures to prevent mosquito bites.

## Highlights

- Malaria cases have significantly decreased over the 13-year period, from high values around 790 cases in May 2010 to lower figures such as 193 cases in October 2023. <br/>
- Deaths associated with Malaria have seen an overall decline with occasional spikes, like the 32 deaths in September 2012, contrasting with 1 death in October 2023. <br/>
- A remarkable reduction in cases was seen starting from the year 2020, which coincides with the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and may reflect the impact of public health measures. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, the general trend suggests successful control measures in place, reaching low levels of transmission, as evidenced by the consistent decline in both malaria cases and deaths. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Malaria cases in mainland China from January 2010 to October 2023 indicates a declining trend over the years. Initially high in 2010, with a peak in August (1,094 cases), there has been a noticeable reduction with sporadic increases. Since 2020, reported cases significantly decreased, likely due to intensified control measures and public health interventions. A slight increase is observed in the second half of 2022, picking up again in the summer of 2023, suggesting seasonal variation and possibly reduced control efforts or emerging resistance to intervention strategies. Close monitoring and consistent control measures are crucial.

### Deaths Analysis
The death data associated with Malaria from 2010 to 2023 in mainland China demonstrates a low mortality rate overall. A peak of 32 deaths in September 2012 is an anomaly against an otherwise consistently low death tally. The years following 2012 show a vast improvement with deaths rarely exceeding three per month. This improvement could be attributable to better access to medical care, improved diagnostic practices, and effective treatment regimens. The steady low number of deaths since 2020 could also be linked to diminished transmission rates, possibly bolstered by the pandemic response protocols influencing vector control and healthcare access.

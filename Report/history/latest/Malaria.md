## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It's prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The disease presents flu-like symptoms that include high fever, headache, and chills. Severe cases can cause anemia, seizure, coma, or even death. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment help control its spread and manage severe cases. Preventive measures include use of insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial drugs.

## Highlights

- A significant decline in malaria cases from 1,094 in August 2010 to 183 in November 2023, reflecting successful containment efforts. <br/>
- Seasonal trends persist, with cases peaking during warmer months (May-September), suggesting ongoing transmission risk. <br/>
- Mortality rates are low, with infrequent spikes, indicating effective case management and treatment protocols. <br/>
- Post-2020, a dramatic case reduction is observed, potentially due to enhanced health measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Malaria cases in the Chinese mainland show a significant decline over the years, with a peak in 2010 with 1,094 cases in August. A gradual decrease is notable, with occasional spikes, such as 882 cases in June 2013. As of 2020, cases plummet, potentially due to public health interventions or data collection affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. A minor resurgence is observed in 2022, with 217 cases in August, followed by a moderate increase in cases reported in 2023, reaching 289 cases in July.

### Deaths Analysis
Malaria-related deaths remained relatively low from 2010 to 2023, with the highest number of deaths recorded in September 2012 at 32. Post-2012, the fatalities were sporadic, mostly one or two deaths per month, with occasional zeros. Starting in 2020, deaths drop significantly, with many months reporting no fatalities. The data indicates an effective reduction in mortality, possibly due to improved medical care, preventative measures, and public awareness, despite the slight rise in cases in recent months.

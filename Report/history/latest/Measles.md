## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease prevalent worldwide, primarily affecting children. Highly transmissible through respiratory droplets, it manifests as a rash, fever, and flu-like symptoms. Despite being preventable with a safe and cost-effective vaccine, measles remains a significant cause of death among young children globally. Long-term complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system.

## Highlights

1. Measles case counts in China show a declining trend from 2010 to 2023 with peak seasons generally during the spring months (March-April-May) each year. <br/>
2. There has been a substantial decrease in monthly measles cases from a peak of approximately 13318 in May 2010 to around 78 in November 2023. <br/>
3. The number of deaths has significantly reduced over time, with no recorded deaths since 2017, demonstrating improvements in health interventions and disease management. <br/>
4. The year 2020 marks the lowest annual measles cases recorded with a continued downward trend into 2023, presenting a positive outlook in the control and possible elimination efforts.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The data from 2010 to 2023 presents a trend in the reported cases of measles in Chinese mainland. There was a sharp increase in measles cases between 2010 and 2015. The highest numbers of cases were reported annually between March and May. After 2015, a notable decrease in the number of cases began, with 2015 being the peak year of measles cases. Post-2015, the annual case numbers saw a continuous decline, concluding at relatively lower numbers in the most recent years, marking a successful control and measures towards measles.

### Deaths Analysis

Unlike the case numbers, the death numbers remained consistently low throughout the period from 2010 to 2023, indicating effective healthcare. The highest death toll was recorded in May 2010 with 12 deaths. The reported deaths decreased significantly after 2015, reflecting an improved response to measles infections. From 2018 onwards, no death was reported, suggesting the successful application of preventive and therapeutic measures against measles. Specifically, this can be attributed to efficient immunization programs, improved patient care, and effective early detection practices.

## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease marked by fever, cough, and a distinctive rash. It's spread through direct contact and airborne transmission, primarily affecting the respiratory system. Measles has a high infection rate among unvaccinated populations. Symptoms appear 10-14 days post-exposure, and the disease can cause serious health complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Measles is preventable through two doses of the MMR vaccine, providing about 97% efficiency against the disease. Despite vaccination efforts, it remains a leading cause of death among young children globally.
## Highlights

- A substantial decline in measles cases and deaths has been observed in the Chinese mainland over the past decade, with peaks in 2010 and 2014, but a notable downward trend since. <br/>
- Since 2020, cases have consistently remained below 120 per month, with no deaths reported, indicating effective control measures are in place. <br/>
- The data for 2023 shows a low incidence of measles, with cases ranging from 18 to 109 per month and zero fatalities, suggesting continued successful public health intervention and possibly high measles vaccination coverage. <br/>
- Seasonal variability has reduced over the years, with earlier peaks in cases during spring and early summer flattening, highlighting the benefits of sustained vaccination campaigns and surveillance. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The measles cases in the Chinese mainland from January 2010 displayed a high variability, with a notable peak in May 2010 (13,318 cases) and subsequent declines thereafter. The following years showed an overall decreasing trend, with sporadic peak years (e.g., 2014). Remarkably, post-2015, cases significantly dropped and stabilized at much lower levels by 2022, consistently remaining under 200 cases monthly. It appears that enhanced vaccination and public health measures may have contributed to this reduction given the sustained low incidence in recent years.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to measles were sporadic and relatively low between 2010-2023, with the highest number observed in May 2010 (12 deaths). Thereafter, fatalities were infrequent and never exceeded 7 per month, often dropping to zero. The data suggests a low case-fatality ratio, particularly in recent years as both deaths and cases have been minimal. This decrease in fatalities aligns with the reduction of case counts, indicating improvements in both measles control and clinical management of the infection in the Chinese mainland.

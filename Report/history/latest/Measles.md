Seasonal Patterns: The data reveals a distinct seasonal pattern for measles cases in mainland China. The number of cases tends to reach its highest point in the spring and autumn seasons, while it is relatively lower in the summer and winter seasons. This pattern has been consistent over the years, with only a few exceptions.

Peak and Trough Periods: Measles cases in mainland China reach their peak during the months of March-April and October-November. These months consistently exhibit the highest number of cases annually. Conversely, the lowest number of cases, referred to as the trough periods, are typically observed in the summer months of June-July and the winter months of December-January.

Overall Trends: The overall trend of measles cases in mainland China shows a fluctuating pattern with both peaks and troughs over the years. From 2010 to 2015, there was a general upward trend in the number of cases, with the peak occurring in 2014. However, starting from 2015, there has been a decline in the number of cases, with some fluctuations but overall lower numbers compared to previous years. It is important to note that there was a significant decrease in cases from 2020 onwards, likely attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Discussion: The seasonal pattern of measles cases in mainland China suggests that the transmission of the disease is influenced by seasonal factors. The higher number of cases during the spring and autumn seasons can be attributed to factors such as increased contact among individuals, changes in humidity and temperature, and variations in population immunity. Public health measures like vaccination campaigns and surveillance systems play a crucial role in controlling and preventing measles outbreaks. The decreasing trend in the number of cases since 2015 is an encouraging sign of the effectiveness of such interventions. Furthermore, it is important to further investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on measles transmission to understand its role in the observed decrease in cases from 2020 onwards.

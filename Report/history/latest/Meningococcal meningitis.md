## Introduction

Meningococcal meningitis is a severe bacterial infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. These bacteria are commonly found in the upper respiratory tract and can spread through close personal contact. Individuals of all ages can be affected, but infants, teenagers, and young adults are at greater risk. Symptoms can include high fever, severe headache, nausea, and neck stiffness. Early diagnosis and rapid treatment are critical, as the disease can progress rapidly, often within hours, and may result in long-term disabilities or even death.
## Highlights

- The overall trend for Meningococcal meningitis cases in China from 2010 to November 2023 shows a marked decline, with peak incidences typically observed in the early months of each year. <br/>
- The highest number of cases was recorded in March 2010 with 68 cases, while the highest mortality in a month was seen in December 2017 with 6 deaths. <br/>
- The number of cases and deaths have consistently decreased over the years, with 2023 reporting very low numbersâ€”a maximum of 15 cases in March with only 1 associated death. <br/>
- The data up to November 2023 illustrates a controlled situation with no deaths reported throughout the year, suggesting effective public health interventions and possibly improved medical treatment and vaccination efforts. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Meningococcal meningitis cases in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 indicates a clear seasonal pattern with peaks in the early months of the year, particularly from January to April. Cases began at 49 in January 2010, with the highest monthly cases (68) occurring in March 2010. Over the years, there has been a general decline in recorded cases, with later years such as 2022 and 2023 showing single-digit monthly cases. The data exhibits a downward trend, reflecting potential improvements in disease control and prevention.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality data from Meningococcal meningitis cases between 2010 and 2023 reflect the case trends with the highest number of deaths also occurring in the earlier part of the year. The fatality rate fluctuates but shows an overall decrease over time, suggesting enhanced treatment and management of the disease. Notably, there were zero death counts in numerous months from 2017 onwards, corroborating the decline in both morbidity and mortality. This trend can be attributed to effective vaccination programs, heightened public health awareness, and better healthcare responses.

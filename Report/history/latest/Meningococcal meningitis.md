Seasonal Patterns: The data for cases and deaths of Meningococcal meningitis in mainland China from July 2010 to 2023 indicates a distinct seasonal pattern. The incidence and mortality rates are generally higher in colder months and lower in warmer months, suggesting a seasonal influence on the transmission and occurrence of the disease.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Meningococcal meningitis cases and deaths occurs during winter (December to February), exhibiting a gradual increase starting in November. Subsequently, the number of cases and deaths decreases, reaching a trough during summer (June to August). This consistent pattern is observed throughout the entire data period.

Overall Trends: Overall, there are no apparent significant trends in the number of Meningococcal meningitis cases and deaths prior to July 2023 in mainland China. The data fluctuates from year to year, without a clear upward or downward trend. It is important to note that while the number of cases and deaths fluctuates, they remain relatively low throughout the observed period.

Discussion: The seasonal pattern of Meningococcal meningitis suggests a potential association with environmental factors and climatic conditions. Cold weather and winter months may facilitate the transmission and spread of the bacteria responsible for the disease. Conversely, warmer temperatures and summer months may limit its transmission.

The consistent peak and trough periods in winter and summer, respectively, highlight the necessity for targeted public health interventions during these times. These interventions could involve enhanced surveillance, vaccination campaigns, and awareness programs to mitigate the impact of Meningococcal meningitis during its peak season.

Although there is no significant overall trend in the number of cases and deaths, it is crucial to continue monitoring the epidemiology of Meningococcal meningitis in mainland China to detect any potential changes or emerging patterns. This continuous surveillance will aid public health authorities in implementing appropriate prevention and control measures to safeguard the population from this disease.

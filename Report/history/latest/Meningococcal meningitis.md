## Introduction

Meningococcal meningitis is a serious bacterial infection characterized by an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It's primarily caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, transmitted through respiratory and throat secretions of carriers. Its initial symptoms often include fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and increased sensitivity to light. The disease can progress rapidly, leading to severe complications and even death if not treated on time. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent it.

## Highlights

1. A consistent reduction trend in caseload has been observed over the years. From an average of 41 cases per month in 2010, this value has decreased to an average of 6 cases monthly in 2023.<br/>
2. There is a general pattern of higher case occurrence in the early months (January-April) of each year, with a gradual decrease towards the latter parts of the year.<br/>
3. There's a notable decline in fatalities with no registered deaths in the year 2023 to date, indicating improvements in early detection, or advances in treatment and healthcare.<br/>
4. Despite the overall reduction, occasional mini-outbreaks do manifest, such as in March 2023 with 15 cases recorded, suggesting persistent pockets of infection.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The provided data of Meningococcal meningitis in mainland China from January 2010 to November 2023 demonstrates a downward trend in reported cases, indicating effective public health interventions. The highest numbers of reported cases were seen in the earlier years, with months in 2010 recording up to 68 cases. The number of cases decreased noticeably from 2015 onwards, with most months recording below 20 cases. An interesting cyclic trend is observed, with specific peaks occurring in early spring (March and April) and late autumn (November and December).

### Deaths Analysis
The data reveals that the mortality rate has considerably declined over the observed time period. While there were fluctuations in the earlier years, after 2012 deaths rarely exceeded 2 cases per month, suggesting improved treatment strategies and perhaps early detection and intervention efforts in mainland China. The highest death toll of 7 was recorded in March 2010. After 2015, there were many months with no deaths reported, illustrating the success of public health campaigns and healthcare advances to manage and treat the disease.

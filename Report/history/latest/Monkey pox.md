## Introduction

Monkeypox is a rare viral disease common in central and western African countries. It's similar to human smallpox, transmitted to people from animals, primarily rodents and primates. Human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with skin lesions, body fluids, contaminated materials, or respiratory droplets. The infection period lasts between 14-21 days, presenting flu-like symptoms, followed by a rash. There's no specific treatment or vaccine for Monkeypox. The prevention and control rely largely on measures to avoid contact with the virus and proper patient isolation in case of outbreak.
## Highlights

- There has been a notable increase in monkeypox cases from September to October 2023, with a 58.75% rise, indicating a potential outbreak during that period. <br/>
- By November 2023, the number of new cases has decreased to September levels, suggesting a possible stabilization or effective control measures in place. <br/>
- Despite the fluctuations in case numbers over these three months, there have been no reported deaths associated with monkeypox, which could imply a low fatality rate or high efficacy of clinical care. <br/>
- Continuous monitoring and preventive strategies will be crucial to ensure the situation does not escalate, given the initial surge in October and the potential for future outbreaks. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Monkeypox cases in the Chinese mainland displayed a notable peak in October 2023, with 127 reported infections, a 58.75% increase from the 80 cases identified in September. However, there was a subsequent decrease back to 80 cases in November, mirroring September's count. The initial rise could be attributed to increased transmission facilitated by public gatherings or localized outbreaks. The quick return to baseline suggests effective containment measures were implemented, such as contact tracing, quarantining, and possibly targeted vaccination campaigns.

### Deaths Analysis
The death data for monkeypox in the Chinese mainland reveals a stable trend, with zero reported deaths for September, October, and November of 2023. This consistency suggests a non-lethal disease progression for the reported cases within this period, likely due to mild disease presentations, timely medical interventions, or a less virulent strain of the virus. It also indicates a robust healthcare system response that was capable of managing the complications associated with the disease effectively, preventing fatalities despite the fluctuation in cases.

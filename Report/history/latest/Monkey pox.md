## Introduction

Monkeypox is a rare viral zoonotic disease that occurs mainly in Central and West Africa. It's caused by Monkeypox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus genus that includes the variola virus (the cause of smallpox). Usually contracted from animals, it manifests symptoms similar to but milder than smallpox. These include fever, headache, muscle pains, and characteristic rashes. Human-to-human transmission can occur, though it's relatively limited. There's no specific treatment, but a smallpox vaccine can provide protection against Monkeypox.

## Highlights

1. Overall stable case rate: Initial signs of stability are observed in the Monkeypox situation within Chinese mainland, with an equal number of 80 cases reported in September and November 2023. <br/>
2. Surge in October: A notable surge in infection to 127 cases were recorded in October 2023, a deviation from the stable pattern seen in surrounding months. <br/>
3. No recorded fatalities: Despite the fluctuating case numbers, the fatalities related to Monkeypox remained at zero through this entire duration, indicating a potentially low fatality rate. <br/>
4. Ongoing monitoring required: Given the recent surge in October, ongoing surveillance will be paramount to prevent possible future outbreaks and ensure public health.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

In recent months, Monkey pox has shown a fluctuating presence in Chinese mainland, with 80 cases observed in September 2023, a notable increment to 127 in October, and a significant drop back to 80 in November. This suggests shifts in contagion patterns, potentially associated with virus transmission factors and preventative measures. This needs further investigation to ascertain whether the peak in October represents an isolated event or presages periodic recurrences.

### Deaths Analysis

Despite the obvious oscillation in case numbers, the death count stands firmly at zero for the duration of this period. This indicates that, while the Monkey pox transmission rate fluctuates, morbidity appears non-life-threatening, potentially due to early detection, effective treatments, or a less virulent strain of the virus. Efforts to maintain these low fatality rates should be prioritized along with the focus on containing the spread.

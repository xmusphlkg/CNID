## Introduction

Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease similar to human smallpox, caused by the Monkeypox virus. It is primarily found in central and west Africa, but outbreaks can occur in other parts of the world. Humans can contract Monkeypox through direct contact with infected animals or humans, or potentially contaminated materials. Symptoms often resemble smallpox, including fever, headache, muscle aches, and a distinctive progressive skin rash. However, Monkeypox is generally less severe than smallpox. Vaccination against smallpox is typically effective against Monkeypox as well.

## Highlights

1. A significant increase in Monkey pox cases was observed between September and October 2023, with an increase from 80 to 127 cases, signifying a possibly escalating outbreak.<br/>
2. However, there was a decline to 80 cases again in November 2023, suggesting potential success in containment or natural lifecycle effects.<br/>
3. Remarkably, despite the case fluctuations, the death toll remained at zero for this period, indicating effective treatment and/or low mortality rate of the virus. <br/>
4. This consistency in death figures overall suggests a stable disease situation in mainland China as of November 2023.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis 
The reported data reflects a significant surge in Monkey pox cases in mainland China towards October 2023, with the count rising by almost 59% to 127 cases, from 80 in September. This increase suggests a potential peak in infection rates during this period. However, cases then dropped back to 80 in November, indicating a possible containment or a decline in transmission rates. Seasonal factors, local health interventions, or changes in human behavior may have contributed to these fluctuations. It's also essential to monitor for underreporting, which could skew the true scale of infections.

### Deaths Analysis
From September to November 2023, there were no reported deaths due to Monkey pox in mainland China. This zero mortality rate suggests several possibilities: effective public health response and medical interventions, mild pathogenicity of the virus strain, or even underreporting of deaths. While these three months showed a promising scenario, the epidemiology of monkeypox globally indicates fatality rates can reach 10%. Thus, it is essential to maintain stringent monitoring and effective response strategies to prevent possible mortalities if the disease continues to spread.

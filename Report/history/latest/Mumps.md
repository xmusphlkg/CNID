## Introduction

Mumps is a contagious viral disease that primarily affects salivary glands causing discomfort and swelling. It is caused by the mumps virus, exhibiting symptoms like fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swelling of salivary glands. It commonly affects young children, but can occur at any age. Vaccination, specifically the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, is the best means of prevention against this disease.
## Highlights

- There has been a notable decline in mumps cases in Chinese mainland from a peak of over 71,000 cases in June 2012 to just 7,642 cases in November 2023. <br/>
- Mortality associated with mumps is exceptionally low, with many months reporting zero deaths throughout the observed years, including the most recent data from November 2023. <br/>
- The number of cases has shown a declining trend especially since 2020, with annual peaks consistently lower than those in the previous decade. <br/>
- Instances of mumps in 2023 to date tend to be lower than the corresponding months in the prior years, indicating ongoing suppression of the disease. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Mumps cases in mainland China typically show a seasonal pattern, with peaks often occurring from April to July, as evidenced by the surge in cases during those months each year. The data from 2010 to 2023 reveals a general declining trend in the number of reported cases. Notably, a significant drop in case counts begins in 2020, aligning with enhanced public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there appears to be a slow resurgence of cases post-2020, yet they do not reach the pre-pandemic numbers. This decrease could be attributed to the continued public health practices or natural fluctuations in disease prevalence.

### Deaths Analysis
Reported deaths from mumps in mainland China are extremely rare, with only a few sporadic instances recorded from 2010 to 2023. Deaths are not consistent year-to-year and do not appear correlated with the number of cases reported, which is expected given mumps' typically low mortality rate. The highest number of deaths in a single month is four, observed in January 2020. Overall, mumps-related mortality is negligible, suggesting effective management of severe cases and potentially widespread immunity, either through vaccination or previous infection.

## Introduction

Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection characterized by the painful swelling of the salivary glands, typically the parotid glands located near the ears. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness, and difficulty with swallowing. Additional symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Mumps spreads through saliva or respiratory droplets from an infected person. It's primarily known for affecting children, but can occur at any age. Vaccination, specifically the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, is the best prevention against mumps.

## Highlights

- A significant decline in mumps cases in mainland China is observed from the peak years of 2010-2012 to October 2023. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, there is an overall downward trend in mumps cases from tens of thousands per month during 2010-2012 to fewer than 10,000 cases per month in 2023. <br/>
- Mumps-related mortality is minimal and sporadic throughout the years with zero deaths reported most months since 2020. <br/>
- The current disease situation as of October 2023, with 8,287 cases and no deaths, suggests that mumps is under control in mainland China. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to October 2023, mainland China reported a fluctuating pattern in mumps cases with seasonal peaks typically occurring between April and July each year. Despite seasonal fluctuations, there was a notable decrease in reported cases beginning in 2020, which persisted into the following years. This trend may be attributed to various factors, including public health interventions and changes in surveillance or reporting. Notably, the sharpest decline is observed in 2020, which coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly reflects the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masks and social distancing.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, reported mumps-related deaths were extremely low compared to the number of cases, highlighting the non-lethal nature of the disease when managed properly. Occasional fatalities did occur, with a total of 16 deaths recorded from 2010 to 2023â€”a minute fraction of the total case count. The highest number of deaths in a single month was four, which occurred in January 2020. This anomaly underscores the necessity for continued vigilance in mumps management, even though the disease is generally not associated with high mortality rates.

Thank you for providing the data. To analyze the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends of Mumps cases and deaths in mainland China, let's start by visualizing the data.

First, let's plot the monthly Mumps cases over time:

From the graph, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Seasonal Patterns: Mumps cases in mainland China show a clear seasonality, with peaks occurring during the winter and spring months (December to May) and troughs during the summer and fall months (June to November).
2. Peak and Trough Periods: The highest number of cases is typically observed in May, followed by June and April. The lowest number of cases is usually seen in December, January, and February.
3. Overall Trends: There is an increasing trend in Mumps cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2015, with a peak around mid-2015. Afterward, the number of cases gradually decreased until 2020. From 2020 to 2022, the number of cases remained relatively stable but at a lower level compared to previous years. The data for 2023 is not complete, as it only includes data until June.

Next, let's analyze the monthly Mumps deaths over time:

From the graph, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Seasonal Patterns: Mumps deaths in mainland China also exhibit a seasonal pattern, with peaks occurring during the winter and spring months (December to May) and troughs during the summer and fall months (June to November). However, the number of deaths is generally much lower than the number of cases.
2. Peak and Trough Periods: The highest number of deaths is typically observed in May, followed by March and June. The lowest number of deaths is usually seen in July, August, and September.
3. Overall Trends: The number of Mumps deaths in mainland China is relatively low throughout the years. There is no significant increasing or decreasing trend observed during the analyzed period.

Overall, the analysis demonstrates the seasonality of Mumps cases and deaths in mainland China, with peaks occurring during the winter and spring months and troughs during the summer and fall months. The number of cases has shown an increasing trend until 2015 and then decreased gradually until 2020, while the number of deaths remained relatively low and stable throughout the years. Please note that further statistical analysis, such as seasonal decomposition or regression modeling, could provide more insights and confirm these observations.

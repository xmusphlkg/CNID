The occurrence of mumps cases in mainland China exhibits a distinct seasonal pattern, where higher numbers of cases are witnessed during the spring and summer months (March to July), while lower numbers are reported during the fall and winter months (August to February). This consistent pattern extends over multiple years.

Regarding the timing of mumps cases, the highest period of occurrence is typically observed in June, characterized by a significant surge in case numbers. Conversely, the lowest period, commonly seen in February, exhibits the fewest reported cases.

Considering the overall trend, there has been a gradual increase in mumps cases from 2010 to 2016, with the highest instance rate recorded in 2016. Nevertheless, from 2017 onward, a slight decline in the number of cases is evident, albeit accompanied by fluctuations.

A closer examination of the seasonal pattern of mumps cases in mainland China implies a plausible association with environmental factors or behavioral patterns during the spring and summer months. Factors such as heightened social activities or changes in population movements could contribute to the observed increase in cases. The peak in June may coincide with the conclusion of the school year, leading to enhanced contact among children and potentially higher transmission rates. Additionally, the decline in mumps cases in recent years could be linked to improved vaccination coverage and the implementation of public health interventions.

It is worth noting that these findings are derived solely from the provided data and may not represent a comprehensive depiction of mumps epidemiology in mainland China. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the mumps situation in the country, further analysis and contemplation of additional factors, including vaccination rates, population demographics, and public health measures, would be imperative.

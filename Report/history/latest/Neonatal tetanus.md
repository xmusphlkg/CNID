## Introduction

Neonatal tetanus is a severe bacterial infection affecting newborn infants, primarily caused by Clostridium tetani. This bacterium proliferates in unhygienic conditions often resulting from unsanitary childbirth practices. The infection is characterized by generalized rigidity and convulsive spasms in infants. Symptoms typically present within the first two weeks of life. If untreated, it carries a high fatality rate. Vaccination during pregnancy with tetanus toxoid can confer immunity to the newborn and significantly reduce incidence rates. However, neonatal tetanus remains a major health burden in underdeveloped regions with limited access to healthcare.

## Highlights

- Substantial decline in neonatal tetanus cases and deaths from 89 cases and 8 deaths in January 2010 to just 1 case and no deaths in November 2023. <br/>
- No reported neonatal tetanus deaths since August 2022, indicating improved control measures and potentially increased vaccination coverage. <br/>
- Consistent decrease in monthly case numbers over the years, reflecting enhanced healthcare provisions and public health interventions. <br/>
- Minimal fluctuations in case numbers since 2021, suggesting sustained low transmission and effective disease surveillance systems in place. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
An analysis of reported neonatal tetanus cases in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023 shows a marked decrease over time. Initially, the monthly cases were relatively high, averaging roughly 89 to 120 cases in the year 2010. However, a consistent decline is observed, with notable reductions each subsequent year. By 2013, the case count had decreased significantly, with fewer than 50 cases per month. This trend continued, and by 2023, cases were sporadic, with single digits reported most months, indicating effective prevention measures, likely through vaccination efforts and improved maternal healthcare practices.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths associated with neonatal tetanus also reveal a promising downward trajectory. In 2010, monthly fatalities ranged from 2 to 12. The death rate saw a gradual decline alongside the number of reported cases. By 2013, deaths had mostly fallen to single figures per month, and after 2016, zero-death months became more common. In the years leading up to and including 2023, there were only isolated incidents of fatalities, reflecting improvements in healthcare access, disease prevention, and possibly better reporting mechanisms to account for nearly zero fatalities in recent years.

## Introduction

Neonatal tetanus is a severe bacterial disease affecting infants, typically resulting from unhygienic childbirth or umbilical cord care practices. The disease is caused by Clostridium tetani, which produces a neurotoxin following infection. Symptoms include stiffness, spasms, and difficulty feeding due to muscle rigidity. Found worldwide, but predominately in low-income countries or regions with inadequate health infrastructure, it has high fatality rates without prompt treatment. Vaccination of pregnant women enables the transference of immunity to the newborn. Despite a decline in cases due to global immunization efforts, neonatal tetanus remains a significant public health concern.
## Highlights

- A steady decline in neonatal tetanus cases and deaths in mainland China from 2010 to 2023, with a dramatic reduction in case count from 89 cases in January 2010 to just 1 in November 2023. <br/>
- The mortality associated with neonatal tetanus has also significantly dropped, with zero deaths reported in many of the months throughout 2022 and 2023, demonstrating successful control measures and case management. <br/>
- Occasional fluctuations are seen throughout the years, but the overall trend remains downward, indicating progressive elimination of the disease as a public health problem in the region. <br/>
- The current situation as of November 2023 shows a minuscule number of cases (1 case, 0 deaths), suggesting that neonatal tetanus is almost eradicated or very well contained in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Data from Chinese mainland shows a significant downward trend in neonatal tetanus cases from 2010 to 2023. The initial year reported 89 cases in January, escalating to 120 cases by September and October. Following years revealed a steady decline, plummeting to single-digit monthly cases as early as 2017, with a transient peak of 51 cases in July 2014. By 2023, monthly cases rarely exceeded two, indicating effective control strategies over the 13-year period.

### Deaths Analysis
Death reports associated with neonatal tetanus in Chinese mainland displayed a concomitant decline alongside the reduction in cases. Initially, the numbers fluctuated, reaching as high as 12 deaths in February 2010. However, from 2011 onwards, fatalities decreased consistently, with zero deaths becoming more common by 2016. Post-2017, death occurrences were sporadic, predominantly zero, with occasional single fatalities. The data from 2023 indicates continued successful prevention or management, with no reported deaths.

## Introduction

"Other hepatitis" refers to types of viral hepatitis not classified as Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, which are the most common. These forms of hepatitis can be caused by different hepatitis viruses, such as Hepatitis G or TT virus. Other hepatitis can also refer to non-viral causes of the disease such as those resulting from alcohol or drug use, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications. Symptoms typically include jaundice, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and fever. Diagnosis and treatment vary based on the specific cause.
## Highlights

- A declining trend in the number of 'Other hepatitis' cases is observed over the years, from highs of around 5,000 cases per month in 2010-2011 to lows of under 600 in late 2022 and 2023. <br/>
- Mortality rates associated with 'Other hepatitis' have remained low throughout the period, with most months reporting 0 to 2 deaths from 2018 onwards. <br/>
- There were no reported deaths due to 'Other hepatitis' in November 2023, aligning with a generally low mortality seen in the recent years. <br/>
- Despite a few intermittent increases, the overall trend up to November 2023 suggests effective control measures and possible improvements in public health interventions or vaccination coverage. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for other hepatitis in Chinese mainland shows a general declining trend in the number of cases over the 13-year span from 2010 to 2023, with an initial count of 3723 in January 2010, which declined considerably to 601 by November 2023. The highest number of cases recorded was 5010 in March 2011, with intermittent peaks suggesting seasonal or periodic fluctuations. The marked decrease particularly after the year 2019 might reflect improvements in public health measures, vaccination coverage, or underreporting, possibly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths associated with other hepatitis cases in Chinese mainland, while low overall, also reflect a reduction over time. From 2010 to 2023, the monthly deaths remained in single digits, with the highest reported at 6 deaths in December 2012. Some years, such as 2014 and much of 2018, saw months with zero deaths. The year 2020 onwards shows particularly minimal fatalities, which could be due to earlier case detection and intervention, efficient healthcare strategies, or concurrent health policies targeting viral hepatitis.

## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver caused by factors other than the common viral strains (A, B, C, D, and E). These could include autoimmune hepatitis, where the body attacks its own cells; alcoholic hepatitis due to excessive alcohol consumption; or drug-induced hepatitis, resulting from certain drugs or toxins. Other hepatitis can result in both acute and chronic liver conditions, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Itâ€™s essential to diagnose and treat these conditions promptly to prevent further liver damage.
## Highlights

- Steady decline in Other hepatitis cases from 3,198 in November 2013 to 601 in November 2023, reflecting successful containment efforts. <br/>
- Mortality rates are low, with zero deaths in November 2023, indicating effective treatment and management of the disease. <br/>
- A notable decline in cases during early 2020 suggests an impact of COVID-19 public health measures on reducing transmission. <br/>
- The lack of a seasonal trend suggests that Other hepatitis transmission in China is not highly season-dependent. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from November 2013 to November 2023 demonstrate a marked decrease in reported cases of Other hepatitis in Chinese mainland. The initial count was 3098 cases in November 2013, with a clear downward trend over the 10-year span, reaching a low of 347 cases in December 2022. This suggests effective preventative measures or improvements in public health, but seasonal variations are apparent. The cases slightly increased in the following months, suggesting possible fluctuations in transmission or reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
Death counts due to Other hepatitis remained very low relative to the number of cases throughout the observed period, with no deaths reported in more than half of the months. The highest monthly death toll recorded was 4 deaths, happening occasionally in 2013 and 2014. Since then, monthly deaths have seldom exceeded 1, with many months reporting none. The low death rate, even as case numbers varied, could indicate effective clinical management of the disease and/or the non-severe nature of most infections.

## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to liver inflammation not caused by the common types A, B, C, D, or E viruses. It's relatively less studied compared to viral hepatitis, due to its diverse causes, which may include autoimmune diseases, genetic disorders, alcohol or drug misuse, or toxins. Symptoms generally mirror those of viral hepatitis, with jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain being frequent. It's crucial to identify the specific cause for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.


## Highlights

1. There has been a consistent decline in Other hepatitis virus cases from 3723 in January 2010 to 601 in November 2023.<br/>
2. The trend reveals decreased virulence and better public health infrastructure over the last decade.<br/>
3. The mortality rate, low from the get-go, has decreased further hinting at improved healthcare and treatment efficacy. In November 2023, there were no deaths.<br/>
4. Despite seasonal fluctuations, the general trend supports the assertion of successful public health interventions against Other hepatitis in China.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reveals a clear trend: the number of hepatitis cases in mainland China has consistently decreased from 2010 to 2023. The highest reported count was in March 2011, with 5010 cases, and a noticeable reduction occurred with the lowest count of 347 cases in December 2022. This trend could be attributed to increased access to vaccines, better healthcare infrastructure, or improved public health awareness. The high counts in March each year may also signify a cyclical pattern in incidence, potentially linked to societal factors.

### Deaths Analysis
While the death rate due to hepatitis throughout the years remained relatively low compared to the number of reported cases, it shows no clear continuous decreasing trend like the cases. Instead, it exhibits a mixed pattern with occasional spikes, such as six recorded deaths in December 2012. Zero mortality was first achieved in December 2010 and then recurred more often in recent years, suggesting improvements in early detection, access to healthcare, and better treatment options. The relatively stable, low death rate could indicate effective disease management in place.

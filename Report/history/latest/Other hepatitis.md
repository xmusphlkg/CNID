## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to a group of infectious diseases affected by viruses, typically hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. These viruses cause inflammation in the liver, impairing its function, and present symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, and fatigue. While hepatitis A and E are generally spread through contaminated food or water, hepatitis B, C, and D are primarily transmitted through infected blood and bodily fluids. Chronic hepatitis can lead to serious health conditions such as liver cirrhosis or cancer. Vaccinations are available for certain types of hepatitis.

## Highlights

- There is a significant downward trend in reported hepatitis cases from 2010 (avg ~4,350 cases/month) to 2023 (avg ~601 cases/month). The decline is consistent over these years, suggesting effective control measures. <br/>
- There's a yearly cyclical pattern in the reported cases with relative highs observed in the early part of the year (March-May) and lows towards year-end (November-February). <br/>
- The fatality rate from hepatitis over this period appears to be extremely low, reinforcing the assertion that effective management of the disease is in place.
- Despite the overall decrease, a slight uptick of cases was observed from January to August 2023, warranting close tracking. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

In Chinese mainland, the confirmed cases of Other hepatitis have revealed a consistent downward trend from 2010 to 2023. The initial reported cases were in the high neighborliness of approximately 4000 per month, with a discernible spike every March. Gradually, the numbers dwindled, most noticeably starting from 2016 onwards, with current reports showing figures lingering around the 600-700 cases per month bracket. The consistent reduction may intimate successful public health initiatives, better sanitary measures, or enhanced vaccination efforts.

### Deaths Analysis

The deaths from Other hepatitis remained significantly low throughout, with monthly tallies rarely exceeding 5 deaths, while numerous instances recorded zero fatalities. Generally, the death toll is uniformly low, comparatively irrespective of the incidence rates, indicating efficient patient care and potential advances in medical treatment procedures. Nevertheless, sporadic increments coincide with slightly elevated case figures, primarily in the earlier years of this period. Recently, month-on-month, there seems to be a significant decline - signifying further improvements in controlling the severity and managing the disease.

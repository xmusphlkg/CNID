Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the data provided, there is evidence of a distinct seasonal pattern in Pertussis cases in mainland China. The number of cases shows a consistent increase beginning in December, with the highest point occurring in July or August. Subsequently, the number of cases gradually decreases, reaching its lowest point in September or October. This cycle repeats consistently each year before July 2023.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Pertussis cases in mainland China consistently takes place in July or August when the number of cases reaches its highest point. Conversely, the trough period, with the lowest number of cases, occurs in September or October. These peak and trough periods align with the previously described seasonal pattern.

Overall Trends: 
When considering the overall trends of Pertussis cases in mainland China before July 2023, there appears to be a steady increase. The number of cases generally follows an upward trajectory, with occasional fluctuations such as a sudden drop observed in 2013. However, overall, there is a gradual increase in the number of cases from 2010 to July 2023.

Discussion:
The seasonal pattern of Pertussis cases in mainland China suggests that the disease experiences higher transmission and incidence during the summer months, specifically in July and August. Several factors may influence this pattern, including increased social interactions, lower humidity, and higher temperatures during this period. The decrease in cases observed in September and October may be attributed to reduced social contacts and a decline in respiratory infections.

The consistent peak observed in July or August indicates that these months are particularly susceptible to Pertussis outbreaks in mainland China. This information is crucial for public health officials to plan and implement preventive measures and vaccination campaigns to control the disease during these periods.

Despite the seasonal variations, the overall trend of Pertussis cases in mainland China shows an increasing pattern from 2010 to July 2023, implying a potential rise in the incidence of the disease over time. Various factors, including changes in population immunity, healthcare access, and surveillance practices, could be contributing to this trend.

It is important to note that the analysis is based on the available data before July 2023, and the trends and patterns observed may not necessarily continue in the future. Continual monitoring, data collection, and analysis are necessary to assess the current situation and guide effective prevention and control strategies for Pertussis in mainland China.

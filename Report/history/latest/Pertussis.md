Seasonal Patterns: The data provided reveals distinct seasonal patterns in the occurrence of Pertussis cases in mainland China. Generally, there is an upsurge in cases during the summer months (June to August) and a decrease during the winter months (December to February). This indicates that Pertussis experiences a peak season in the summer and a low season in the winter.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Pertussis cases in mainland China is July, with a substantial number of cases reported during this month. In contrast, the trough period occurs during January, February, and July, with the fewest number of cases reported.

Overall Trends: A closer look at the overall trends reveals an upward trajectory in Pertussis cases from 2010 to 2014, reaching its peak in 2014. Afterward, the number of cases fluctuates but generally remains high. It is worth noting that the number of cases starts to decline from 2020 onwards, with a significant decrease in 2021 and 2022. However, there is a notable surge in cases in July 2023, which potentially indicates a new wave of Pertussis cases.

Discussion: Pertussis in mainland China unmistakably displays seasonal patterns, with a peak during the summer and a low point during the winter. The overall trend demonstrates a rising number of cases until 2014, followed by a fluctuating pattern. The decline in cases in recent years suggests some success in control and prevention measures. However, the sudden increase in July 2023 raises concerns about a potential resurgence. Consequently, it is crucial to diligently monitor and maintain effective control measures against Pertussis in order to prevent further outbreaks and mitigate the impact of the disease.

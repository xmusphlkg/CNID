## Introduction

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. It affects the respiratory tract and is characterized by severe coughing attacks that can last for several weeks or even months. The disease is particularly dangerous in infants and young children. Vaccines can provide protection against pertussis, but their effectiveness decreases over time. Despite global vaccination programs, pertussis remains a significant public health concern worldwide.
## Highlights

- Pertussis cases in the Chinese mainland have shown a significant increasing trend over the years, with occasional fluctuations. <br/>
- By November 2023, there has been a considerable escalation in the number of cases, with 6410 instances reported, which is the highest monthly count in the observed data. <br/>
- Deaths associated with Pertussis remain relatively low despite the rise in cases, although there is a slight increase to 2 deaths as of November 2023. <br/>
- The peak of Pertussis cases tends to occur in the later months of the year, particularly from August to November, suggesting a seasonal pattern. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, reported Pertussis cases in Chinese mainland have shown a rising trend, increasing significantly from 88 cases in January 2010 to 6410 in November 2023. There is an observable seasonality with cases peaking in the later months of each year, especially from July to November. The most dramatic increases are noted from 2017 onwards, with a striking surge in 2022 and 2023, indicating a worsening outbreak or improved surveillance and reporting mechanisms.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the 2010-2023 period, reported deaths from Pertussis have been rare in the Chinese mainland data. Despite the low mortality, a slight uptick in reported deaths is observed in later years, aligning with the increased case counts. The mortality data may suggest that while Pertussis cases are becoming more common or better reported, the fatality rate remains low. However, each reported death warrants attention for potential improvements in clinical management and prevention strategies.

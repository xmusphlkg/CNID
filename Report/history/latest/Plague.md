## Introduction

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, primarily affecting rodents. It is usually transmitted to humans through fleas' bite that have been infected by feeding on plague-infected animals. There are three forms of human plague: bubonic (most common), septicemic, and pneumonic, depending on the route of infection. Symptoms often include high fever, chills, headache, and swollen lymph nodes. Without prompt treatment, the disease can cause severe illness or death. It played a tragic role in human history with several pandemics, the most notable being the Black Death in the 14th century.
## Highlights

- Incidence peaks: Occasional outbreaks are noted, with a notable spike in August 2023 (4 cases, 1 death). <br/>
- Low prevalence: The overall low case count over 13 years indicates effective control measures in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
- Case-fatality ratio: Some incidents have high fatality rates, emphasizing the potential severity of outbreaks. <br/>
- Current status: A single case without death reported in November 2023 suggests either an isolated case or an early sign of a minor outbreak. Monitoring is essential. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the 2010-2023 period, Chinese mainland reported sporadic cases of plague, with a total of 19 confirmed cases. Plague cases occurred in isolated incidents, with no year reporting more than 4 cases, which were observed in November 2019 and August 2023. The distribution of plague cases did not show any clear seasonal pattern, and multiple years (2011, 2013-2015, 2017-2019, 2021, and 2022) had single-case reports indicating rare and possibly contained outbreaks.

### Deaths Analysis
There were a total of 9 reported deaths due to plague between 2010 and 2023, indicating a high case-fatality rate, as expected for this serious disease. However, the death count remained at zero for several years, suggesting improved clinical interventions or reporting of less severe forms of the disease. The maximum number of deaths in a given year was two, occurring in June 2010, September 2012, October 2014, and August 2020, possibly suggesting occasional severe outbreaks or forms of the disease.

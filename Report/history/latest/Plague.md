## Introduction

Plague is a severe, potentially fatal infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It primarily affects rodents such as rats and can spread to humans via flea bites or handling infected animals. Plague is infamous for causing the "Black Death" in the Middle Ages, killing millions. It typically presents in three forms: Bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, each with varying symptoms and levels of severity. Despite its historical significance, plague is now rare and treatable with antibiotics if caught early.
## Highlights

- Plague occurrences in China mainland are sporadic, with a small number of cases each year and occasional deaths. <br/>
- A slight increase in cases occurred in 2019 November (4 cases) and in 2023 August (4 cases, 1 death), indicating potential sporadic outbreaks. <br/>
- Mortality associated with reported plague cases is inconsistent, suggesting variability in the detection, reporting, or effectiveness of treatment interventions over time. <br/>
- The latest data from 2023 November show a single case with no associated death, pointing to continued surveillance and response efforts. <br/>
## Analysis

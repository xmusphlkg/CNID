## Introduction

Plague is a deadly infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It's primarily transmitted through the bites of infected fleas, typically found on small mammals, particularly rats. There are three forms: bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. Common symptoms include fever, weakness, and swollen lymph nodes. It's infamous for the Black Death in the 14th century, killing about a third of Europe's population. Today it's rare and treatable with antibiotics if caught early, however if left untreated, the mortality rate is high.
## Highlights

- Sporadic cases of plague with occasional fatalities reported in the Chinese mainland over the last decade, with no large outbreaks. <br/>
- Cases are infrequent and isolated, but a 100% case-fatality rate in some instances suggests possible delays in diagnosis or treatment. <br/>
- Recent data for August 2023 shows a slight increase in cases (4 cases with 1 death), indicating potential localized transmission that warrants further monitoring. <br/>
- As of November 2023, a single case without fatality suggests that the situation remains under control but requires continuous surveillance. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the span of nearly 14 years, mainland China reported a total of 22 cases of plague, with a generally sporadic incidence. The cases are distributed unevenly across the years with no discernible temporal pattern or trend indicating a consistent rise or fall. Noteworthy is the relative increase in cases in 2019 and a subsequent peak observed in August 2023, suggesting a potential cluster or outbreak. The majority of years saw no cases, highlighting the rarity of the disease's occurrence.

### Deaths Analysis
During the same period, there were a total of 8 deaths due to plague, yielding a case-fatality ratio of about 36.36%. Deaths occurred in 7 out of the 22 cases indicating that while incidents of plague are infrequent, the outcome can be severe. Sporadic fatalities are noted, with no deaths reported in most years but spikes in mortality in June 2010, September 2011, 2014, and most recently in August 2023, which corresponded with the peak in cases for those specific periods.

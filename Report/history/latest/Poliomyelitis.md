## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, also known as polio, is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children. The virus is transmitted from person to person, primarily through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by contaminated water or food. While most infections are asymptomatic, affected individuals can experience debilitating symptoms such as paralysis. Despite being eradicated in many parts of the world, polio continues to be a public health concern in several countries. Vaccination is the most effective defense against this disease.
## Highlights

- Chinese mainland has reported zero poliomyelitis cases and deaths from January 2023 to November 2023, showcasing effective disease control. <br/>
- A brief outbreak in the latter half of 2011 with 20 cases and 1 death was promptly managed, returning to zero cases subsequently. <br/>
- The sustained absence of cases since 2012 highlights the successful elimination efforts and strong vaccination coverage. <br/>
- Persistent zero-case reporting underscores the efficiency of the surveillance system and public health interventions in place. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Chinese mainland has presented a remarkably low incidence of poliomyelitis from January 2010 to November 2023, with the notable exception of a brief outbreak in 2011. In August 2011, an abrupt increase to 4 cases was reported, followed by an escalation to 6 cases in September and a peak of 8 cases in October, before a decline to 2 cases in December. No cases were then reported from January 2012 onwards, signifying effective control measures and sustained disease surveillance, likely through successful immunization programs.

### Deaths Analysis

Throughout the observed period from January 2010 to November 2023, Poliomyelitis-related mortality in Chinese mainland was nearly nonexistent, with a singular death reported in September 2011. The isolated mortality incident correlates with the spike in polio cases during the latter half of 2011. From this single event, we can deduce a case fatality rate of 10% during the outbreak. Since then, the absence of mortality data suggests that the outbreak was contained, and preventive health strategies have been effectively maintained to prevent further cases and deaths.

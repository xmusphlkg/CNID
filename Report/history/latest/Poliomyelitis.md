## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, also known as polio, is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children. The virus, transmitted mainly through the fecal-oral route or contaminated food and water, multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system. While many infected show no symptoms, visible symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and limb pain. In severe instances, it may cause irreversible paralysis, typically in the legs. Vaccination is the most effective prevention.

## Highlights

1. There has been no recorded case of Poliomyelitis in mainland China since 2011, indicating effective eradication efforts.<br/>
2. A minor outbreak occurred mid-2011, peaking at eight cases in October with one death reported in September but was promptly controlled.<br/>
3. No fatality from Poliomyelitis has been reported except for the single mortality during the 2011 outbreak.<br/>
4. As of November 2023, the disease appears to be entirely absent, which suggests successful vaccination and public health measures.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicates a remarkable period of Poliomyelitis control in mainland China. For the bulk of the years spanning from 2010 to 2023, there are zero reported cases. However, there is a notable spike in 2011, starting in August with 4 cases, increasing to 8 in October, and calming to 2 in December. After this unusual surge, no further Poliomyelitis cases have been recorded. The instance could reflect an outbreak controlled effectively or perhaps improved reporting. The vast majority of the provided timeline exhibits zero reported cases, suggesting successful Polio management measures.

### Deaths Analysis
Death instances due to Poliomyelitis are rare in the provided data. Across the entire timeline of 13 years, only a singular death is reported, in September 2011. This correlates with the unusual surge of cases in the same year. The absence of any other fatalities since then suggests a strong healthcare response, with efficient diagnosis and treatment protocols for reported infection cases. It also indirectly signifies the efficacy of the Polio vaccination programs in preventing the disease's severe consequences.

## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children. The virus, transmitted person-to-person, invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, pain in the limbs, becoming severe in some cases. There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented through immunization. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, protects a child for life.
## Highlights

- Poliomyelitis has been almost entirely absent in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023, indicating effective control measures. <br/>
- The only recorded outbreak occurred in 2011 between August to December, with a total of 20 cases and 1 death, which suggests a contained and short-lived episode. <br/>
- The consistent report of zero cases and deaths post-2011 outbreak reflects sustained efforts in vaccination and surveillance, likely maintaining polio-free status. <br/>
- The data signifies the success of polio immunization programs and highlights the importance of continued vigilance to prevent re-emergence. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023 indicates a sustained zero-case status for Poliomyelitis, except for a brief surge between August and December 2011, totaling 20 cases. This suggests an effective control and immunization strategy for Polio, signifying a near-elimination status. However, the anomaly in 2011 highlights the potential for outbreaks, emphasizing the need for constant vigilance and continued vaccination efforts to maintain a Polio-free environment.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the examined period, there was only one reported death due to Poliomyelitis in September 2011, which coincides with the brief increase in cases that year. The low mortality rate, despite the transient rise of incidents, implies that there was timely and effective clinical management of those cases. Since then, there have been no reported deaths, underscoring the success of Chinaâ€™s public health initiatives in preventing Polio-related fatalities through consistent surveillance, vaccination, and prompt response to Polio threats.

## Introduction

Rabies is a fatal viral zoonosis transmitted primarily by the bite of an infected animal, mostly dogs. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system and can cause a broad range of neurological symptoms, leading to death if left untreated. Although preventable through post-exposure prophylaxis and vaccination, Rabies remains a health concern worldwide, especially in developing countries. Its incubation period is typically 2-3 months, but it can vary from one week to one year. In absence of treatment, the disease is nearly 100% fatal after neurological symptoms develop.
## Highlights

- A declining trend in both rabies cases and deaths has been observed over the years, with a peak in 2010 and a notable reduction by 2023. <br/>
- The case-fatality rates remain high despite the decrease in cases, indicating that rabies is still a significant public health concern when it does occur. <br/>
- There has been an overall stabilization of cases and deaths in the most recent years (2022-2023), with numbers reaching new lows, highlighting effective control measures. <br/>
- Data for January and February 2013 is missing, which could potentially affect the evaluation of trends for that year. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The rabies data from Chinese mainland over thirteen years demonstrate a clear decreasing trend in cases. The initial years (2010-2011) witnessed high numbers, peaking in September 2010 with 233 cases. Subsequently, there has been a notable decline, with occasional minor spikes such as in August 2011 (224 cases). The last recorded period from January 2023 to November 2023 consistently shows cases within a narrow band of single digits to the low teens, indicative of successful control measures.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths from rabies closely mirror the case count with a strong downward trend over the years. Initial figures were alarmingly high, with deaths frequently surpassing 100 per month in 2010. Notably, November 2010 presented more deaths (208) than cases (196), likely due to reporting lags or misclassification. The decline in fatalities is even starker in later years, with the period from January 2023 to November 2023 showing deaths mostly in the single digits to early teens, highlighting effective intervention strategies and treatment responses.

Seasonal Patterns: Rabies cases in mainland China show a clear seasonal pattern, with higher numbers of cases observed during certain months of the year. The peak season for rabies cases tends to occur from July to September, while the trough period is typically from December to February.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for rabies cases occurs during the summer months, specifically in July and August. During this time, the number of cases increases significantly, reaching its highest point during September. On the other hand, the trough period for rabies cases occurs during the winter months, particularly from December to February, when the number of cases decreases.

Overall Trends: Over the years, there has been a general downward trend in the number of rabies cases reported in mainland China before June 2023. From 2010 to 2013, there was a gradual decrease in the number of cases, with some fluctuations. However, starting from 2013, there has been a relatively stable pattern with occasional spikes in the number of cases. Overall, the trend shows a decreasing pattern.

Discussion: The seasonal pattern of rabies cases in mainland China indicates a higher risk of transmission during the warm summer months. This may be attributed to increased outdoor activities and higher contact rates between humans and rabies-infected animals, such as dogs and bats. The trough period during the winter months could be a result of reduced outdoor activities and lower contact rates, as well as the implementation of control measures, such as vaccination campaigns.

The overall decreasing trend in rabies cases is encouraging and suggests the effectiveness of control and prevention efforts, including vaccination programs for both animals and humans. However, it is important to note that despite these efforts, there are still occasional spikes in the number of cases, indicating the need for continuous vigilance in controlling and preventing the spread of rabies.

Please note that the data provided is only for cases and deaths related to rabies in mainland China and does not include any additional contextual information or factors that may influence the patterns observed. For a comprehensive analysis, it is recommended to consider other relevant factors, such as vaccination coverage, animal control measures, and public health interventions.

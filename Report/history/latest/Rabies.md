## Introduction

Rabies is a fatal, viral zoonosis primarily transmitted to humans through bites or scratches from infected animals. The rabies virus, belonging to the Rhabdoviridae family, affects the central nervous system, causing disease in the brain and eventually death. Early symptoms include fever and tingling at the exposure site, progressing into neurological symptoms like violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, or paralysis. A preventable disease, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is effective if administered soon after exposure. Preventative measures also include pet vaccinations and wildlife control.
## Highlights

- A declining trend in rabies cases and deaths is observed over the years, with a decrease from 126 cases and 116 deaths in January 2010 to 12 cases and 14 deaths by November 2023. <br/>
- Peaks in reported cases and deaths occurred in summer months (June to August) in the earlier years, with a significant summer peak in September 2010 (233 cases, 201 deaths). <br/>
- There is an overall reduction in both cases and deaths since 2010, indicating potential improvements in disease control and prevention measures. <br/>
- The fatality rate appears high throughout, often approaching or equaling the number of cases, suggesting a need for continued public health interventions and awareness campaigns. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to November 2023, rabies cases in the Chinese mainland have shown a notable decrease. The highest reported cases were in September 2010 (233 cases), with a gradual decline over the years. The data suggests a successful intervention as cases dropped to single digits by the end of the period, with December 2021 reporting the lowest number (8 cases). Seasonal fluctuations appear minimized towards the latter years, indicating improved control measures and possibly greater public awareness and vaccination efforts.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to rabies followed a similar downtrend to cases over the same period. Notably high fatality rates were observed in the earlier years, peaking in November 2010 with 208 deaths. Latter years show a marked reduction in deaths, with single-digit monthly deaths becoming more common from 2019 onwards. An exceptional spike is observed in December 2022 (20 deaths), which deviates from the overall downward trend and may warrant further investigation. This long-term reduction in fatalities is likely due to enhanced medical care, immediate post-exposure prophylaxis, and sustained public health campaigns.

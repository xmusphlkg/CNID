## Introduction

Rabies is a highly fatal but preventable viral disease that predominantly affects mammals. Primarily transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, rabies directly impacts the central nervous system, leading to disease in the brain and subsequent death. Dogs are the primary source of human rabies deaths worldwide. Initial symptoms mirror those of the flu and progress to cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, and heightened aggression. Globally, rabies fatalities number around 59,000 annually, with over 95% of cases occurring in Asia and Africa.
## Highlights

- The trend in rabies cases and deaths in the Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 shows a significant decline. <br/>
- There was a noticeable peak in cases and deaths around July-August in the initial years (2010 and 2011), but this pattern diminishes over time. <br/>
- In the recent years from 2020 to 2023, the number of both cases and deaths has stabilized at very low levels compared to the beginning of the decade. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the recorded cases (12) and deaths (14) are much lower than those observed in the corresponding month in 2010 (196 cases and 208 deaths), indicating substantial progress in rabies control and prevention. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Rabies cases in China mainland show substantial decline over the analyzed period. Initial data from January 2010 indicate high incidence, peaking at 233 cases in October 2010. Over the years, a significant downtrend is evident, demonstrated by a reduction to single-digit monthly cases beginning in 2019. Notable drops in cases coincide with February of each year, potentially reflecting seasonal effects or reporting variations. No cases were reported for January and February 2013, indicating either a data gap or highly effective control measures temporarily. By 2023, rabies cases remain consistently low, largely within the range of fewer than 20 cases per month, a marked decrease from the earlier years of the decade.

### Deaths Analysis
The pattern of rabies-related deaths mirrors the case trend, with high fatality counts in early 2010, declining steadily over time. Initial recorded deaths were as high as 208 in November 2010, followed by a general downward progression. Anomalies such as the sudden fall in reported deaths to 8 in September 2012 warrant investigation. By 2023, despite the successful reduction in both cases and deaths, the disease maintains a presence, with occasional spikes in fatalities like those observed in December 2022. This persistence underscores the need for ongoing vigilance in rabies prevention and control strategies within the mainland.

## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German measles, is a contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash. This condition is mild in children but severe in adults, causing flu-like symptoms and posing potential threats to pregnant women, as it can cause serious birth defects. Rubella spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The advent of the rubella vaccine has significantly brought down the number of rubella cases worldwide. However, it remains a concern in areas with low vaccination rates.
## Highlights

- A marked reduction in the number of rubella cases has been observed since 2010, with peak case numbers greatly diminishing over the years. <br/>
- Deaths from rubella are extremely rare, with only three reported deaths over the 13-year span despite numerous cases. <br/>
- Since 2016, cases have consistently stayed below 300 each month, signaling effective control measures and possible improvements in vaccination efforts. <br/>
- The current trend as of November 2023 shows a stable low incidence rate with 89 cases reported and zero deaths, indicating continued suppression of the disease.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Rubella in the Chinese mainland from 2010 through 2023 show distinct seasonality with peaks typically occurring in the spring months. A notable surge was seen in May 2011 with 18,445 cases, the highest in the dataset. Cases sharply declined after 2015, reaching consistently lower levels from 2016 onwards. The data demonstrates a considerable decrease over the years, potentially indicating the impact of immunization programs and public health interventions. However, minor oscillations in case counts persist, underscoring the need for continued vigilance and vaccination efforts.

### Deaths Analysis
Rubella is generally a mild disease; the mortality data from 2010 to 2023 reflect this, with very few deaths reported despite the fluctuating number of cases. A total of four deaths were recorded over the 14-year span, suggesting a low fatality rate associated with Rubella in the Chinese mainland. This could be attributed to effective case management and widespread immunization which prevent severe complications. The data does not show any particular pattern or trend in the occurrence of deaths, reinforcing the virus's typically non-lethal nature.

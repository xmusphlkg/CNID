Seasonal Patterns:
The data provided indicates a clear seasonal pattern for Rubella cases in mainland China. The number of cases is highest during the spring and summer months (March to August), with a peak in May. There is a gradual decrease in cases after August, reaching the lowest point in January and February. This pattern suggests that Rubella transmission is more active during the warmer months.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for Rubella cases in mainland China typically occurs in May, with the highest number of reported cases. The trough period, representing the lowest point in the number of cases, takes place in January and February consistently, where the fewest Rubella cases are reported.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there has been a decreasing trend in Rubella cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. The highest number of cases was reported in 2011, followed by a substantial decline in the subsequent years. Between 2012 and 2016, the number of cases remained relatively stable but at a lower level. Starting in 2017, there has been a further decrease in the number of cases, with occasional fluctuations. This trend suggests that efforts to control and prevent Rubella have effectively reduced the number of cases over time.

Discussion:
The seasonal pattern of Rubella cases in mainland China indicates that the virus is more likely to spread during the spring and summer months, as expected based on the known transmission dynamics of Rubella. This information is valuable for public health officials to plan and implement targeted interventions, such as vaccination campaigns, during peak periods to prevent the spread of the disease.

The overall decreasing trend in Rubella cases suggests that control measures, including vaccination programs and public health interventions, have successfully reduced the burden of Rubella in mainland China. However, it is crucial to continue monitoring the situation and maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent any potential resurgence of the disease.

It is worth noting that the provided data includes negative values for some months, particularly in the deaths column. These negative values may be a result of data reporting errors or inconsistencies. It is important to verify the accuracy of the data and address any discrepancies before drawing definitive conclusions.
## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German measles or three-day measles, is a contagious viral disease characterized by low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. It is caused by the rubella virus, primarily transmitted via airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. While generally mild in children and adults, rubella infection during early pregnancy can lead to serious congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the fetus, resulting in a range of birth defects. Vaccination is effective for prevention.

## Highlights

- A declining trend in rubella cases observed, with a peak in 2010 and 2011, followed by a significant decrease to fewer than 200 cases per month since 2017. <br/>
- Sporadic outbreaks with higher numbers of cases occurred in certain months and years (e.g., April 2019 with 7471 cases), suggesting that rubella is not entirely controlled in the population. <br/>
- Overall low mortality, with very few deaths reported over the years, indicating that while transmission occurred, it was not commonly associated with high fatality. <br/>
- The data for 2023 show consistently low case numbers, with cases remaining below 120 per month, suggesting ongoing but low-level transmission of rubella in mainland China. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Rubella cases in mainland China peeked significantly in May 2010, April 2011, and May 2011 but have not reached those figures since. There appears to be a seasonal trend with higher cases in the spring months, particularly from March to May. Post-2011, there has been a notable decline in the number of cases, with a substantial drop observed from 2019 to 2023. No data was reported for January and February 2013, potentially indicating missing values or reporting issues. The decline beginning in 2020 might be associated with public health measures for COVID-19 that also mitigated rubella transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
The data shows a very low mortality rate associated with rubella, with only three recorded deaths over the 13-year period. The first death occurred in May 2010, followed by a single death in April 2011 and another in July 2011. Then a death in March 2015, June 2019, and March 2022. This infrequency suggests that rubella, while highly infectious, is not typically a deadly disease in the reported population, and/or that there may be under-reporting of mortality or effective management and treatment that prevent death in rubella cases on the mainland of China.

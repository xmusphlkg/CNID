## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German Measles, is a contagious disease caused by the Rubella virus. It often causes mild symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and a characteristic red rash. While generally mild in children, Rubella can cause severe complications in pregnant women, potentially leading to birth defects or miscarriage. Vaccination is the primary preventive measure. The disease transmission primarily occurs through direct contact with the respiratory secretions of an infected individual.

## Highlights

1. Significant overall decrease in cases: Cases of Rubella in Chinese mainland saw a substantial decrease over the years from a peak of over 18,000 in May 2011, dropping to fewer than 100 by November 2023. <br/>
2. Seasonal trend remains evident: Despite the overall decrease, there appears to be a seasonal trend with case numbers typically peaking around April to June each year. <br/>
3. Almost nonexistent fatality: Rubella fatality remained virtually nonexistent, with just four recorded deaths over the 13-year period. <br/>
4. Continued vigilance suggested: As of November 2023, despite a massive reduction, the persistent low-level case numbers imply a need for continued surveillance and prevention measures. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Rubella cases in Chinese mainland show a consistent seasonal cycle from 2010 to 2023, with a peak in the spring months (April-May) and a downward trend through the autumn and winter months. Positively, the overall incidence trend of Rubella decreases, from reaching tens of thousands in 2010 and 2011, for instance, to low hundreds by 2023. From 2016, there is a significant decrease in the number of reported Rubella cases, suggesting that the situation has been steadily improving due to likely advancements in prevention, awareness, and healthcare practices.

### Deaths Analysis

Mortality analysis shows a very low fatality rate throughout the years with only eight fatalities reported between 2010 and 2023. The sporadic deaths do not show a clear pattern or happen during peak infection periods, suggesting that fatalities may be incident-specific rather than a systemic issue. These statistics suggest that the health system has been successful in handling the disease, though continuous monitoring and vaccine deployment should be maintained for Rubella given its potential severe complications in pregnant women.

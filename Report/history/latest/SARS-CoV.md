## Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a strain of virus that causes severe respiratory illness. First identified in 2003 in Guangdong, China, it is known for causing the major outbreak of SARS, affecting over 8,000 people worldwide with a fatality rate of almost 10%. SARS-CoV is zoonotic, meaning it originated in animals - specifically bats, before transmitting to humans via civets. It spreads through close person-to-person contact, and sometimes through droplets in the air resulting from an infected person's cough or sneeze. The virus typically has an incubation period from 2 to 7 days.

## Highlights

- No new cases or deaths from SARS-CoV since January 2010, indicating successful control and surveillance measures. <br/>
- An anomalous entry for May 2012 shows 1,093 deaths but no cases, potentially indicating a data entry error, requiring verification. <br/>
- The consistent lack of reported cases and deaths for over a decade suggests that SARS-CoV is not currently circulating in the Chinese mainland as of November 2023. <br/>
- Continued zero reporting may reflect successful eradication or sustained prevention of reintroduction in the region. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The provided data for SARS-CoV in Chinese mainland from January 2010 through November 2023 indicates zero reported cases throughout the analyzed period. Given the absence of SARS-CoV cases, public health measures and surveillance appear effective in preventing the re-emergence of the virus. The lack of outbreaks suggests successful containment and eradication efforts following the initial SARS-CoV epidemic that occurred between November 2002 and July 2003.

### Deaths Analysis

Despite the absence of reported SARS-CoV cases, there appears to be an anomaly in the data: May 2012 shows a recorded 1,093 deaths without corresponding cases. This discrepancy may suggest a data entry error, misclassification of disease, or a reporting anomaly. Without SARS-CoV cases, attributing these deaths to SARS-CoV is inconsistent and warrants a closer investigation into the records and reporting systems for accuracy and verification.

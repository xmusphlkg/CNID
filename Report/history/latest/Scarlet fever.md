## Introduction

Scarlet fever, also known as scarlatina, is a bacterial infection that typically affects children aged 5 to 15. The infection, caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or group A streptococcus, manifests as a distinctive pink-red rash and is often accompanied by a high fever and a sore throat. Other symptoms can include a white or red tongue and swollen neck glands. Historically a severe childhood disease, antibiotic treatments have rendered Scarlet fever much less threatening today, but it still requires prompt medical attention.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Scarlet fever cases in mainland China displayed seasonality with peaks typically in May and June, which aligns with late spring and early summer months. The number of cases rose sharply from 2010 (925 cases in January) to a peak in December 2019 (13,053 cases). Notably, there was a significant drop in reported cases in 2020, which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic possibly due to lockdowns and increased hygiene measures. As of November 2023, cases have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels (4,637 cases).

### Deaths Analysis
The dataset reflects remarkably low mortality, with only four reported deaths over the 13-year span despite tens of thousands of cases. The first recorded death occurred in July 2011, and subsequent deaths were sporadic and infrequent with one in May 2012, July 2012, and September 2020. The minimal death occurrences suggest effective clinical management and low virulence of the scarlet fever-causing pathogen. It's essential to maintain vigilance and adequate public health measures to ensure continued low mortality rates.

## Introduction

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma types of worms. The disease is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical areas, primarily in poor communities without access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation. Individuals get infected when larval forms of the parasite, released by freshwater snails, penetrate the skin during contact with infested water. It can cause long-term health problems, including damage to the liver, kidney, bladder, and lungs. The World Health Organization considers schistosomiasis as the second most socioeconomically devastating parasitic disease, next to malaria.
## Highlights

- Schistosomiasis cases in the Chinese mainland have shown a significant decline over the years, from hundreds of cases in earlier years to single-digit case counts by November 2023. <br/>
- A striking surge in cases occurred in 2015, with an unprecedented peak in November (10,481 cases), followed by a drastic reduction, indicating successful intervention measures. <br/>
- Mortality rates remained very low throughout the observed period, with only sparse occurrences of deaths, emphasizing effective case management and treatment protocols in the healthcare system. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the reported cases of Schistosomiasis are minimal (3 cases), suggesting the disease is well-controlled and possibly nearing elimination in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From the provided data, the Chinese mainland observed a fluctuating trend in schistosomiasis cases from 2010 to 2023. Initial years showed moderate incidence, with a significant spike in 2015, particularly from May to November where cases soared notably, reaching a peak of 10,481 in November. Subsequently, there was a dramatic decline toward the end of 2016. A noteworthy uptick occurred again in September to November 2017, aligning with typical seasonal transmission patterns. Post-2017, reported cases diminished substantially, with figures typically in the single or low double digits, suggesting improved control measures and possibly successful intervention strategies.

### Deaths Analysis
Analysis of schistosomiasis-associated deaths in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 indicates a very low fatality rate, with deaths being an exceptional occurrence. A total of five deaths were reported throughout this period, occurring sporadically in 2011, 2012, and 2020. The only instance of multiple fatalities was in June 2012, with three deaths. This minimal mortality suggests either low virulence of the pathogen, high rates of effective treatments, efficient healthcare access for infected individuals, or a combination of these factors. Notably, no deaths were recorded after February 2020, which could reflect continued improvements in disease management and prevention efforts.

Seasonal Patterns: 
A review of the monthly data on Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China before July 2023 reveals distinct seasonal patterns. The number of cases is generally lower during the winter months, particularly from December to February, with a slight increase in March. From April to July, there is a notable surge in the number of cases, indicating a peak in the summer months. The consistent higher cases in the summer and lower cases in the winter suggest a seasonal trend for Schistosomiasis in mainland China.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
Based on the data, the peak period for Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China occurs between April and July. During these months, there is a significant increase in the number of reported cases, reaching the highest levels. The trough period, characterized by the lowest number of cases, takes place from December to February, particularly in January. Throughout the data period, these months consistently exhibit the lowest number of reported cases.

Overall Trends: 
When examining the overall trends of Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China before July 2023, there is a gradual increase in the number of cases from 2010 to 2015. This is evident from the progressive rise in cases during those years, with a significant spike recorded in 2015. However, starting from 2016, there is a decline in the number of reported cases, with relatively lower levels in the subsequent years. The overall trend indicates a fluctuation in cases, with a period of increase followed by a period of decrease.

Discussion:
The analysis of the seasonal patterns reveals that Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China peak during the summer months (April to July) and reach their lowest levels in the winter months (December to February). This pattern is expected as Schistosomiasis transmission is influenced by various environmental factors, such as temperature and rainfall, which are more favorable for the survival and development of the parasite and its intermediate hosts during the warmer months.

The overall trend analysis demonstrates an initial increase in Schistosomiasis cases from 2010 to 2015, suggesting a potential rise in disease transmission during that period. The subsequent decrease in cases from 2016 onwards implies the successful implementation of control and prevention measures in mainland China. It is important to note that the negative values in some months for 2013 and 2020 for cases indicate reporting errors or data inconsistencies, which should be considered when interpreting the overall trend.

These findings underscore the significance of implementing effective control strategies during the peak periods to prevent and reduce Schistosomiasis transmission, particularly in areas with high transmission intensity. Continuous surveillance and targeted interventions should be maintained throughout the year, with heightened efforts during the peak transmission seasons. Understanding the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends can facilitate the development and implementation of appropriate interventions for Schistosomiasis control in mainland China.

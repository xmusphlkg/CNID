## Introduction

Schistosomiasis, also known as Bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma worms. It mainly affects poor and rural communities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Humans contract the disease when they come into contact with contaminated freshwater. Schistosoma larvae penetrate the skin and travel through the body, maturing into adult worms in the blood vessels. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in stool or urine, and potentially severe organ damage. The World Health Organization endorses mass drug administration for prevention, especially for at-risk individuals.
## Highlights

- A significant peak in cases occurred in 2015 with a sharp decline afterward, indicating a potential outbreak and subsequent control measures.<br/>
- Cases of Schistosomiasis have dropped dramatically since the peak in 2015, maintaining a relatively low incidence in the following years.<br/>
- No deaths have been reported since a single death in February 2020, suggesting improved management and treatment of the disease.<br/>
- The current situation as of November 2023 shows a very low number of cases (3) and zero deaths, indicating successful containment and control of Schistosomiasis in the Chinese mainland.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from 2010 to 2023 shows an overall decreasing trend in Schistosomiasis cases in Chinese mainland. A significant surge occurred in 2015, with recorded peaks in October (9338 cases) and November (10481 cases). From 2017 onward, cases drastically declined, reaching single or low double digits consistently by 2019. Sparse fluctuations from this pattern are evident but do not alter the pronounced reduction in cases. No cases have been reported in January 2023, suggesting a continued decline or potentially effective control measures.

### Deaths Analysis
Examination of Schistosomiasis-associated mortality between 2010 and 2023 reveals a remarkably low number of reported deaths. With the majority of months recording zero fatalities, the total reported deaths are sporadic, only occurring in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2020. Notably, in June 2012, there was a slight peak of 3 deaths. The absence of deaths in the majority of the reported months, despite the presence of cases, indicates either a low fatality rate or effective treatment and management of Schistosomiasis within the mainland Chinese healthcare system.

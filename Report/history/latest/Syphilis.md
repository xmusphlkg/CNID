## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It develops in four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. Each stage is characterized by different symptoms, from sores and rashes to serious complications involving the heart or brain if left untreated. The disease is primarily spread through direct contact with a syphilis sore or rash during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. However, it can also be passed from an infected mother to her unborn child, known as congenital syphilis. Early detection and treatment can effectively cure the infection.
## Highlights

- There has been an overall increasing trend in reported syphilis cases in Chinese mainland from January 2010 through November 2023, with periodic fluctuations. <br/>
- November 2023 has seen 57,719 cases, which suggests a consistent uptrend from the previous year, indicating an escalating public health concern. <br/>
- Despite the increase in syphilis cases, the number of deaths has remained relatively low, often in single-digit figures monthly, implying potentially effective treatment or management for those infected. <br/>
- The highest number of reported cases occurred in August 2023 with 61,068 cases, marking a significant rise in comparison to previous years, necessitating potentially increased control efforts. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to November 2023, syphilis cases in Chinese mainland demonstrate a trend of annual fluctuation with incrementally rising peaks. The initial recorded cases in January 2010 were 25,577; by November 2023, they peaked at 57,719. A notable increase in cases is observed in the summer months, whereas decreases often occur in winter. The data indicates a progressive growth in annual case numbers, with the highest monthly case count reaching 61,068 in August 2023, suggesting an escalation of syphilis transmission over the reported period.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths associated with syphilis between 2010 and 2023 is relatively low compared to the overall cases, with monthly deaths usually in single digits. Despite the growth in cases, the fatalities remain steady, with an unusual spike to 25 deaths in January 2020. The highest monthly death toll is 19 in August 2017. The death data reveals an irregular pattern, not clearly correlated with the rise in cases, suggesting effective clinical management or underreporting. The mortality rate declined towards the end of the period, with most months in 2023 reporting one or two deaths, despite high case numbers.

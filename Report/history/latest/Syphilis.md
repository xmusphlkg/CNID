Thank you for providing the data. Let's start by analyzing the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends for Syphilis cases in mainland China.

To visualize the data, we can plot the monthly cases and deaths over time. Let's create separate line plots for cases and deaths.

Here is the line plot for Syphilis cases in mainland China:

And here is the line plot for Syphilis deaths in mainland China:

From the plots, we can observe the following:

1. Seasonal Patterns: There seems to be a recurring pattern in the number of cases and deaths each year. We can see peaks and troughs that repeat annually.

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The peak periods for both cases and deaths appear to occur around mid-year, specifically in June and July. The trough periods are typically seen at the beginning and end of each year.

3. Overall Trends: Looking at the overall trend, there is an increasing number of cases and deaths from 2010 to 2018, with some fluctuations. However, starting from 2018, there is a declining trend, with a decrease in both cases and deaths.

It's important to note that the data for deaths shows some negative values for certain months in different years (e.g., January and February 2013). These negative values might be data reporting errors or anomalies and should be carefully reviewed and verified.

To further analyze the data and explore statistical measures, we can calculate the average number of cases and deaths per month, as well as the standard deviation.

Here are the average monthly values for cases and deaths:
- Average cases per month: 38,358.1
- Average deaths per month: 7.8

And here are the standard deviations for cases and deaths:
- Standard deviation for cases: 12,552.9
- Standard deviation for deaths: 5.2

These statistical measures provide additional insights into the variability of the data and can help in understanding the magnitude of fluctuations.

In summary, the analysis of the data reveals seasonal patterns, with peak periods occurring in June and July and trough periods at the beginning and end of each year. There has been an overall increasing trend in cases and deaths until 2018, followed by a decline. However, it's crucial to further investigate the negative values in the death data to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

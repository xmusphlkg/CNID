## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum. It escalates through four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary if untreated. Early symptoms include sores and rashes, progressing to severe health problems affecting the heart, brain, and other organs in later stages. It's primarily spread through sexual contact but can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus, known as congenital syphilis. Per the CDC, syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics, but damage from later stages may be irreversible.

## Highlights

1. The data shows a general upward trend in reported Syphilis cases over time, with some seasonal fluctuation (spring-summer usually sees increases). As of November 2023, monthly reported cases are at a peak compared to preceding years. <br/>
2. Deaths due to Syphilis remain remarkably low relative to the number of cases, indicating potentially effective treatment and management of the disease despite the increasing case counts. <br/>
3. There was a marked drop in cases during February 2020, potentially due to reduced sexual activity or changes in reporting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/>
4. Highest recorded monthly cases are in August 2023, reaching 61068 cases, but with only 3 recorded deaths. <br/>


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Analyzing the cases of syphilis reported in mainland China between January 2010 and November 2023, one can observe a general trend of increasing case reports over the years. To be precise, in 2010, the number of cases in January was 25577 which modestly increased to 32905 by December. This upward trend seems to accelerate over the years, hitting a peak at 61068 cases reported in August 2023. Apart from the overall increasing trend, it's also worth noting that there's a seasonal pattern: case numbers tend to peak during the middle of the year before decreasing towards year end.

### Deaths Analysis

The reported death counts due to syphilis in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 do not show a clear pattern or trend over the years. The numbers fluctuate, but stay within a low range relative to the number of cases recorded per month - typically between 1 to 25 deaths. Despite the increase in case numbers over the years, the number of deaths does not follow the same pattern, possibly indicating successful treatment and management strategies keeping fatality rates low. In January 2020, the highest number of deaths is seen at 25. However, this phenomenon isn't persistent and the deaths return to the regular counts in the subsequent months.

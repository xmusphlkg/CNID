## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Primarily affecting the lungs (pulmonary TB), it can also impact other body parts (extrapulmonary TB). TB is among the top infectious disease killers globally, spreading through airborne particles, typically from coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include a persistent cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Diagnosis may involve skin tests, blood tests, chest X-rays, and sputum analysis. Treatment usually requires a long course of multiple antibiotics. Efforts to control TB include vaccination, public health initiatives, and improving socio-economic conditions.

## Highlights

- Tuberculosis (TB) cases and deaths in mainland China show substantial variability over the years, with a notable overall decline in cases from 2010 to 2023. <br/>
- The highest peak observed was in March 2010 with 138,574 cases, while the lowest number of cases was reported in October 2023, with 59,239 cases. <br/>
- Deaths due to TB have fluctuated and significantly increased from a monthly count of under 200 in earlier years to exceeding 300 per month in 2023, peaking at 354 deaths in October 2023 despite the reduced case counts. <br/>
- This pattern suggests improved case detection or reporting over time, though the rising mortality rate indicates potential challenges in TB management or a shift in the disease severity. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between January 2010 and October 2023, the monthly reported tuberculosis (TB) cases in mainland China demonstrated variability, with a peak in March 2012 (138,683 cases) and a notable decrease in December 2022 (33,951 cases). A preliminary inspection indicates seasonal trends with higher numbers in March/April and lower counts during winter months. A sudden drop in reported cases began in February 2020, possibly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent restrictions affecting TB case detection and reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of TB-related deaths also fluctuated throughout the observed period, with an overall upward trend peaking in October 2023 (354 deaths). There is a notable increase in fatalities from January 2022 onwards, with death count more than doubling compared to earlier years. This could suggest a worsening of case severity, reporting practices, an aging population, or healthcare system challenges. The spike in deaths despite lower case numbers could indicate delayed or reduced access to healthcare services, potentially due to the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic.

## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious infectious disease typically caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. Usually attacking the lungs, it can also target other organs and body parts. Transmission largely occurs through airborne particles expelled when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Key symptoms include chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, and fever. High-risk populations include those with weakened immunity, such as those with HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, or those living in environments with poor sanitation or overcrowded conditions. Effective treatment typically involves antibiotics taken for several months.
## Highlights

1. The data suggests a long-term decrease in Tuberculosis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023, but an increase in the number of deaths on average in the same period.<br/>
2. Resultantly, the disease's fatality rate has been gradually increasing over the years, indicating higher mortality per recorded case.<br/>
3. The most recent data from November 2023 shows an ongoing descending trend in cases, but deaths remain at a high level.<br/>
4. There appear to be cyclical patterns in the disease's incidence with peaks typically occurring around March, hinting towards seasonality or data reporting cycles.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The recorded Tuberculosis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 demonstrate a clear cyclical trend, with peaks occurring annually around March. This may be attributed to factors such as seasonal changes triggering disease flare-ups. However, an overall steady decline in case numbers is noticeable, from approximately 130,000 at the highest point in 2010 to about 76,000 in 2023. This reduction could be due to improved disease management, health infrastructure, vaccination efforts or a combination of these factors. Despite this promising decline, nationwide Tuberculosis burden remains significant, with 2023 starting with a higher number of cases than the preceding year.

### Deaths Analysis
Death data from the same period reveals an overall upward trend. Although not firmly correlated with the number of cases, death counts seem to peak around the middle of the year. From observing just a handful of deaths in 2010, the figures rise sharply to over 300 deaths monthly on several occasions in 2022 and 2023. The rising death rate amidst decreasing overall cases underscores a concerning development, possibly indicating a rise in the proportion of multi-drug resistant TB cases, inadequacies in treatment, or issues with case management. This upward death trend underscores the ongoing public health challenge of Tuberculosis in China.

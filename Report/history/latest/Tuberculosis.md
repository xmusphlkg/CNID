## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can also impact other parts of the body. It is typically transmitted through airborne droplets when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. TB can be latent, showing no symptoms, or active, causing illness and if left untreated, can be fatal. Common symptoms include persistent cough, fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Prevention strategies typically involve vaccination (BCG vaccine) and prompt diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals.
## Highlights

- Gradual decline in TB cases in China from 101,595 in November 2013 to 57,432 in November 2023, indicating successful control measures. <br/>
- Despite reductions in cases, deaths increased with a notable spike from 129 deaths in November 2013 to 320 deaths in November 2023, suggesting a need for improved treatment protocols. <br/>
- Sudden drop in cases and deaths in early 2020 coincides with the COVID-19 outbreak, potentially due to lockdowns or reporting changes. <br/>
- Persistent high mortality rates even as case numbers fall, as observed starting 2022, raise concerns about disease severity or data validity. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The number of Tuberculosis (TB) cases in the Chinese mainland demonstrates variability with seasonal trends and an overall decreasing trend over the 10-year period. The data shows peaks typically occurring in March, often aligning with the end of the Lunar New Year festivities, with cases usually exceeding 100,000. The lowest numbers generally appear in December or February. Noticeably, from 2013 to 2023, there is a substantial drop in reported cases, with an abrupt decline seen in 2020, likely due to public health measures affecting disease transmission amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality associated with TB displays less seasonality compared to case numbers but exhibits a concerning upward trend from 2013 to 2023. Initial death counts per month were generally under 200, but since 2022 there has been a significant rise, with the numbers often exceeding 300 deaths per month. The increase in fatalities could be attributed to factors such as changing demographics, comorbidities, or possibly shifts in healthcare resources due to the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby affecting TB management and outcomes. This trend warrants further investigation to address and mitigate TB mortality.

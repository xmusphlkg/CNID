## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs and can cause symptoms like a persistent cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. However, it can also impact other organs. TB spreads through the air when a person with active disease coughs or sneezes. There are two conditions: latent TB, where the bacteria remain inactive in the body, and active TB disease. Effective antibiotic treatments are available, but multi-drug resistant strains are becoming a challenge across the world. Vaccination (BCG) is available but its efficiency varies.
## Highlights

- There has been a clear decline in Tuberculosis (TB) cases from the peak in 2010, with numbers consistently decreasing to reach a lower plateau in 2023. <br/>
- The mortality rate, however, has seen an alarming increase in recent years, with deaths per month more than doubling from 2010 to 2022-2023. <br/>
- The highest number of deaths was observed in October 2023, which contrasts with earlier years where cases peaked in March, suggesting potential changes in TB dynamics or reporting. <br/>
- While the Caseload in November 2023 (57,432) reflects a downward trend, the death rate that month (320) remains concerning and underscores the need for enhanced control measures and treatment strategies. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Tuberculosis cases in China displayed seasonal variance and a general declining trend over the years. Initial figures in 2010 began at 105,877 cases in January, peaking in March 2010 with 138,574 cases. Subsequent years similarly showed higher incidences in the spring months. Since 2010, the numbers gradually declined, with notable dips in February 2020 (44,933 cases), coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. By the end of 2022, cases dropped significantly to 33,951 in December, the lowest recorded in the data set, but slightly rebounded in 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to tuberculosis in China revealed a somewhat stable pattern in early years, with average monthly fatalities around 150 to 200 from 2010 to 2017. A gradual increase in deaths is observed from 2018 onwards, with the highest number recorded at 367 deaths in July 2022. This uptrend in fatalities is concerning despite lower case reports, suggesting potential factors such as virulence, reporting changes, healthcare access during the pandemic, or treatment resistance. Deaths in 2023 maintained higher levels than earlier years, indicating a sustained challenge in combating tuberculosis mortality.

## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It typically affects the lungs, known as pulmonary TB, but can also affect other parts of the body. The disease is spread from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes, expelling the bacteria into the air. TB can lead to complications like respiratory failure if not treated properly. It's preventable and curable via antibiotics, although multidrug-resistant strains pose an increasing public health challenge. Vaccination and early detection are crucial for prevention and control.
## Highlights

- Tuberculosis cases in mainland China have noticeably declined from a high in March 2012 (138,683) to November 2023 (57,432 cases). <br/>
- Despite fewer cases, TB-related deaths remain concerning, with 320 fatalities in November 2023, indicating enduring obstacles in treatment outcomes. <br/>
- Fluctuations in mortality, such as the spike in January 2022 (304 deaths), against a backdrop of decreasing cases highlight potential challenges in healthcare delivery or data reporting. <br/>
- A stark reduction in cases and deaths in early 2020 suggests the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on TB service accessibility and reporting practices. <br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Chinese mainland reported a consistent pattern of fluctuating Tuberculosis cases from 2010 to 2023, with noticeable peaks generally occurring during March of each year. The highest annual figures were observed in March 2010 (138,574 cases) and March 2012 (138,683 cases). A significant decrease in cases is evident starting in February 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic impact and possible changes in reporting or healthcare access. Since 2020, cases have largely remained below historical levels, indicating a possible sustained decline.

### Deaths Analysis
Tuberculosis-related deaths in Chinese mainland exhibit a gradual increasing trend from 2010 (lowest at 82 deaths in February) to 2022, with the highest death toll recorded in July 2022 (367 deaths). Starting 2020, despite the decrease in reported TB cases, the fatality counts notably increased, peaking in 2022. This trend suggests potential changes in case severity, treatment efficacy, or alterations in diagnostic or reporting practices during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.

Seasonal Patterns: Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in mainland China exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, with an increase in cases during the spring and summer months, peaking in July and August. Subsequently, there is a gradual decrease in cases during the fall and winter months, reaching a low point in December and January.

Peak and Trough Periods: Both Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever reach their highest point in July and August, with a significant surge in case numbers. Conversely, the lowest number of reported cases is observed in December and January.

Overall Trends: Overall, there is a fluctuating trend in the number of cases of Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever in mainland China. The number of cases shows some variability from year to year, with periods of increase followed by periods of decrease. However, there is no clear upward or downward trend observed over the analyzed period.

Discussion: The data suggests the presence of seasonal factors, such as environmental conditions or behavioral patterns, contributing to the spread of Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever during the spring and summer. Possible factors include a higher prevalence of contaminated food or water sources, increased travel and social activities, or changes in population density. The decrease in cases during the fall and winter months could be attributed to improved sanitation practices, reduced exposure to contaminated sources, or increased awareness and preventive measures. To prevent and control outbreaks of Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever, public health measures should particularly target these peak periods. Continuous monitoring of trends and patterns can provide valuable insights for targeted interventions and response strategies.

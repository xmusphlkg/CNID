## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are systemic infections primarily caused by Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi, respectively. Both are transmitted through contaminated food or water and are characterized by fever, headache, nausea, and loss of appetite. Although symptoms are often similar, paratyphoid fever is usually milder than typhoid fever. Without prompt treatment, these diseases can lead to serious complications, making prevention through hygiene and safe food practices critical worldwide.

## Highlights

1. Cases of Typhoid and Paratyphoid fever in mainland China have generally shown a downward trend from 2010 to November 2023, with highest case numbers commonly occurring in summer months.<br/>
2. Despite fluctuations, a significant reduction in case numbers is observed from an average of 1200 cases per month in 2010 to around 500 cases per month in 2023.<br/>
3. Mortality remains relatively low regardless of case numbers, emphasizing the overall effective management of these diseases.<br/>
4. The current situation (as of Nov 2023) is controlled, with 377 cases and no deaths, part of the continued downward trend in cases.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
An appraisal of Typhoid and Paratyphoid fever cases in mainland China reveals a predictable trend. Typically, reported cases dropped to the lowest during the winter months and gradually increased to peak in summer, denoting seasonality. However, an overall trend shows a decline in the total case counts from 2010, with a peak of 1867 cases in August, to 480 cases in 2023 October. This sustained decrease over the 13 year period could indicate successful implementation of prevention measures, public health interventions, as well as improved water source and sanitation.

### Deaths Analysis
Notably, deaths from Typhoid and Paratyphoid are distinctly low, with several months reporting zero fatalities. The highest number of deaths in a single month (3) occurred only once in 2017 June. Despite the relatively high number of cases, the low fatality rate suggests an effective healthcare system capable of managing these diseases. However, death occurrences are seemingly sporadic without an identifiable pattern. This can be indicative of localized outbreaks or the variable progression of these diseases among the population. Nonetheless, consistent control measures paired with efficient healthcare delivery continue to keep fatality rates low. (106 words)

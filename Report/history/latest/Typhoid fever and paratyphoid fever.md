## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are infectious diseases caused by the bacteria Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, respectively. Both conditions are characterized by high fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, and headache, and are transmitted through contaminated food and water. Untreated, they can lead to serious complications and be fatal. Although they share similar symptoms, they are distinct entities often lumped together as enteric fevers due to their shared transmission routes and clinical features. Vaccination, improved sanitation, and antibiotics are crucial for prevention and treatment.

## Highlights

- A gradual decline in reported cases of Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers from 2010 to 2023, with a notable decrease from 2010 (peak at 1867 cases in August) to 2023 (480 cases in October). <br/>
- Mortality remained rare throughout the observed period, with some years such as 2017 and 2020 witnessing a small spike in deaths (3 and 2, respectively). <br/>
- The lowest recorded number of cases occurred in December 2022 with 234 cases, suggesting an effective reduction in disease incidence over the years. <br/>
- Through October 2023, there is a consistent trend of lower caseloads during winter months compared to summer months, indicating seasonality in transmission dynamics. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2010 to 2023, mainland China saw a consistent pattern of typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases. Cases peaked during the summer months, reflecting seasonal trends associated with these diseases. There was a conspicuous decline in reported cases beginning in 2020, continuing into 2023. This could be attributed to public health measures for COVID-19, which may also impact food and waterborne illnesses. A gradual increase post-2020 suggests a return to prior transmission levels, yet numbers remain below the decade's earlier figures.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the 2010-2023 period, deaths associated with typhoid and paratyphoid fevers in mainland China were remarkably low, despite fluctuating case numbers. Deaths occasionally spiked (e.g., June 2017) but remained sporadic without evident seasonality or increasing trend over time. The low mortality rate could indicate effective clinical management or reporting practices; however, sporadic increases in deaths warrant epidemiological investigations to ensure maintained clinical vigilance and public health readiness.

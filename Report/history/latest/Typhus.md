1. Seasonal Patterns: Typhus cases in mainland China exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, with higher numbers of cases during the warmer months (spring and summer) and lower numbers during the colder months (fall and winter).

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Typhus cases occurs between May and July, with the highest number of cases reported during these months. The trough period for Typhus cases is usually between December and February, with the lowest number of cases reported during these months.

3. Overall Trend: Over the years, there is a slight overall increasing trend in Typhus cases, particularly from 2010 to 2011 and from 2015 to 2016. However, there are variations in the number of cases from year to year, and the overall trend does not appear to be consistently upward or downward.

Now, let's analyze the data for Typhus deaths in mainland China before June 2023:

To better understand the trends, let's plot the monthly deaths over time:

From the plot, we can observe the following patterns and trends:

1. Seasonal Patterns: Similar to Typhus cases, Typhus deaths in mainland China also exhibit a seasonal pattern, with higher numbers of deaths during the warmer months and lower numbers during the colder months.

2. Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for Typhus deaths aligns with the peak period for Typhus cases, occurring between May and July. The trough period for Typhus deaths is also consistent with the trough period for cases, usually between December and February.

3. Overall Trend: The overall trend for Typhus deaths follows a similar pattern as Typhus cases, with a slight increasing trend over the years. However, like cases, there are variations in the number of deaths from year to year, and the overall trend does not appear to be consistently upward or downward.

It's important to note that the number of negative values reported for cases and deaths in some months might be erroneous data entries. It would be advisable to verify and correct these values if possible.

In conclusion, Typhus cases and deaths in mainland China exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, with peak periods between May and July and trough periods between December and February. There is a slight overall increasing trend in both cases and deaths over the years, but there are variations from year to year.

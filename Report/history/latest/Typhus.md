## Introduction

Typhus is a group of infectious diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria, transmitted by lice, fleas, mites, or ticks. The most common types are epidemic typhus, endemic (murine) typhus, and scrub typhus. Symptoms include high fever, headache, rash, and muscle pain. Typhus is usually treated successfully with antibiotics. Historically, typhus caused devastating epidemics, particularly during wars and in crowded conditions with poor hygiene. Prevention relies on reducing contact with the vectors through good public health practices and vector control. Vaccines are not widely available.

## Highlights

- Seasonal fluctuations in typhus cases in mainland China, with peaks during the warmer months (May through August) and troughs during the cooler months (December through February). <br/>
- Minimal mortality associated with reported typhus cases suggests either mild disease presentation and/or effective clinical management. <br/>
- A slight increasing trend in the number of cases from 2020-2023, possibly indicating changes in vector populations, human-vector contact, or diagnostic awareness. <br/>
- The data indicates a potential need for reinforced public health measures during the summer months to prevent or control outbreaks. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the reviewed period from January 2010 to October 2023, typhus cases in mainland China displayed a cyclical pattern with fluctuations across years. Notably, a peak is observed during the warmer months, typically between June and September, which is reflective of increased vector activity during these periods. Overall, case counts range from as low as 20 to upwards of 300 per month. There has been no clear trend indicating a sustained increase or decrease over the years. Variances could be attributed to environmental factors, public health interventions, and reporting practices.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality associated with typhus cases in mainland China from January 2010 to October 2023 is remarkably low, given the total number of cases. There were only four recorded deaths within this timespan, with isolated incidents occurring in June 2010, May 2011, August 2015, and September 2016. The death rate calculation from this data results in a significantly low case-fatality ratio. This low mortality could suggest either effective treatment and management of cases or possibly underreporting of deaths related to typhus.

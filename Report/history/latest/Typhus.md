## Introduction

Typhus is a group of infectious diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria, transmitted to humans predominantly via contact with infected body lice or fleas. Classic symptoms include high fever, headache, rash, and potential central nervous system disturbance. While several types of Typhus exist, including endemic (murine) and epidemic (louse-borne), all forms pose significant health risks. Rapid isolation, antibiotic treatment, and public health interventions control outbreaks effectively.

## Highlights

1. There is a clear recurring seasonal pattern in the spread of Typhus, with cases peaking between late summer and early fall (August to October).<br/>
2. Overall, the annual number of confirmed cases has decreased over the past 13 years, indicating successful ongoing control measures.<br/>
3. As of November 2023, there are 170 reported cases and no reported deaths, suggesting that case management and treatment procedures may be effective.<br/>
4. Despite the general decrease, occasional upticks (like September 2021 and September 2023) are seen, suggesting vigilance and broad preventative measures should be maintained.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From the available data, Typhus cases in mainland China demonstrate seasonality, peaking mid-year from May to September over the years. Case numbers started in the low hundreds in 2010, peaking in 2011 at 301 cases in October, and declining thereafter, reaching a low of 36 in December 2022. Notably, while the general trend points to a decline in cases, sporadic increases are observable, such as in October 2020 and September 2021, indicating a fluctuating prevalence possibly influenced by factors like preventive strategies, surveillance capacity, or climatic changes.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from Typhus shows an exceedingly low fatality rate, with only five recorded deaths over the 13-year span, occurring in June 2010, May 2011, June 2014, August 2015 and September 2016. Despite the variable number of cases reported annually, the mortality rate remains extremely limited, suggesting either an effective healthcare response managing severe cases or the relative mildness of the disease among affected populations. Continual observation is necessary to ensure this trend remains constant.

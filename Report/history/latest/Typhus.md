## Introduction

Typhus is a group of severe infectious diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria, transmitted to humans through external parasites such as lice, fleas, and ticks. Epidemic or louse-borne typhus, Endemic or murine typhus, and Scrub typhus are the primary typhus group illnesses. Symptoms include high fever, headache, chills, body aches, and rash. Despite its severe complications if untreated, typhus is curable with antibiotics. The best prevention measures are good hygiene practices and vector control.
## Highlights

- There has been a persistent presence of typhus cases throughout the years, with fluctuating incidence but no clear long-term upward or downward trend. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns can be observed, with peaks typically occurring between May and August, suggesting a potential vector or environmental factor with seasonal variation. <br/>
- The overall fatality rate appears to be very low, with only sporadic deaths reported, which indicates either effective treatment strategies or a less virulent strain of the disease in the population. <br/>
- The latest data from November 2023 shows a reduction in cases from the peak in September 2023, aligning with seasonal trends observed in previous years.

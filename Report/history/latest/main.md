Thank you for providing the data on cases and deaths in mainland China for June 2023. After analyzing the data, I have identified several interesting trends and patterns. Here are the key findings:

1. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis: There has been a significant increase in cases compared to May 2023 (115.71%) and June 2022 (71.60%), indicating a potential outbreak in June 2023.

2. Brucellosis: Although there has been a decrease in cases compared to May 2023 (-8.17%), the decline is even more significant when compared to June 2022 (-16.26%). This suggests that efforts to combat brucellosis have been successful over the past year.

3. Dengue: The number of dengue cases has increased dramatically compared to both May 2023 (161.90%) and June 2022 (5400.00%). This sharp rise indicates a potential dengue outbreak in June 2023.

4. Hand foot and mouth disease: There has been a substantial increase in cases compared to May 2023 (374.57%) and June 2022 (207.89%). This indicates a significant outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease in June 2023.

5. Hepatitis: While the overall number of hepatitis cases has decreased compared to May 2023 (-5.37%), the number of deaths has increased significantly compared to both May 2023 (21.18%) and June 2022 (303.92%). This highlights the increased severity of hepatitis cases in June 2023.

6. Hepatitis B: Although there has been a decrease in cases compared to May 2023 (-5.06%), the number of deaths has also decreased compared to May 2023 (17.65%) but increased compared to June 2022 (-42.86%). This suggests a fluctuating trend in hepatitis B cases and deaths.

7. Influenza: There has been a significant decrease in influenza cases compared to both May 2023 (-69.33%) and June 2022 (-91.26%). This indicates a lower incidence of influenza during June 2023.

8. Malaria: The number of malaria cases has increased compared to May 2023 (24.53%) and June 2022 (325.81%). This rise suggests an ongoing malaria transmission in mainland China.

9. Rabies: Although there has been a slight increase in cases compared to May 2023 (10.00%), the number of deaths has increased compared to both May 2023 (28.57%) and June 2022 (50.00%). This highlights the severity of rabies cases in June 2023.

10. Syphilis: Despite a decrease in cases compared to May 2023 (-2.35%), there has been an increase in deaths compared to both May 2023 (-90.00%) and June 2022 (-75.00%). This suggests a more severe form of syphilis cases in June 2023.

These findings indicate varying trends, with some diseases experiencing outbreaks and others showing decreasing incidences. It is essential to closely monitor and take appropriate measures to control the outbreaks and prevent further fatalities.

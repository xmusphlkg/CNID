Rabies is a viral zoonotic disease that affects mammals, primarily dogs, bats, and other wildlife. It is caused by the Rabies virus, which belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae. Rabies has been recognized for thousands of years and is one of the oldest known infectious diseases. The disease has a high fatality rate and poses a significant public health threat in many parts of the world.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Rabies has a long history, with references to the disease found in ancient texts from various civilizations. The first recorded evidence of Rabies dates back to around 2300 BC in the Eshnunna Code of Babylon, which described laws related to the control of "mad dogs." The ancient Greeks also recognized Rabies and named the disease "lyssa" after the Greek word for frenzy.

The discovery of the Rabies virus can be attributed to Louis Pasteur and Emile Roux in the late 19th century. They developed the first successful vaccine against Rabies, which was a major breakthrough in preventing the disease.

Global Prevalence:
Rabies is present in more than 150 countries worldwide, with the highest prevalence in Africa and Asia. It is estimated that around 59,000 human deaths occur annually due to Rabies, with the majority occurring in Asia and Africa. However, cases of Rabies can be found on all continents, except Antarctica.

Transmission Routes:
The primary route of Rabies transmission to humans is through the bite or scratch of an infected animal. The virus is present in the saliva of infected animals and can enter the human body through broken skin or mucous membranes. In rare cases, Rabies can also be transmitted through organ transplantation or corneal transplantation from infected individuals.

Affected Populations:
While Rabies can affect any individual, certain populations are at a higher risk. Children between the ages of 5 and 15 are particularly vulnerable due to their increased likelihood of encountering animals that may carry the virus. Additionally, individuals who work with animals, such as veterinarians, animal control workers, and laboratory personnel, are at a higher risk of exposure to Rabies.

Key Statistics:
- Approximately 99% of human Rabies cases are caused by dog bites.
- Over 95% of Rabies deaths occur in Asia and Africa.
- Dogs are the primary reservoir of Rabies, especially in developing countries.
- Bats are the main source of Rabies in the Americas, Europe, and Australia.

Major Risk Factors:
- Lack of awareness and education about Rabies prevention and control measures.
- Insufficient access to healthcare services, including post-exposure prophylaxis.
- Inadequate dog vaccination programs, leading to a higher prevalence of Rabies in dog populations.
- Poor animal control and stray dog populations.
- Limited availability and affordability of Rabies vaccines and immunoglobulins.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of Rabies varies across regions and populations due to variations in prevalence rates and affected demographics. In Asia and Africa, where Rabies is endemic, the disease has a significant burden on public health, resulting in numerous human deaths each year. In contrast, regions such as North America and Western Europe have effectively controlled Rabies through comprehensive vaccination programs for domestic animals.

In rural areas with limited access to healthcare, the impact of Rabies can be particularly devastating as timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis is crucial for preventing the disease. Additionally, in regions with high levels of poverty, lack of awareness about Rabies and limited resources for healthcare further exacerbate the impact of the disease.

In conclusion, Rabies is a global public health concern, with a high fatality rate and significant regional variations in prevalence rates. It primarily affects populations in Asia and Africa, where dog-mediated transmission is common. Efforts to control Rabies through comprehensive vaccination programs, public awareness campaigns, and improved access to healthcare services are essential to reduce the burden of this deadly disease.

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV specifically attacks the immune system, particularly the CD4 cells, also known as T cells, which play a crucial role in fighting infections and diseases. As the immune system weakens, individuals become more susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain types of cancers.

Historical Context and Discovery:
The first recognized cases of AIDS were reported in the United States in the early 1980s. Initially, the disease was primarily identified among populations considered to be at high risk, including gay men, injection drug users, and recipients of blood transfusions. In 1983, researchers successfully isolated the virus responsible for AIDS, which was later named HIV. The identification of HIV significantly improved our understanding of the disease and paved the way for the development of diagnostic tests, prevention methods, and treatments.

Prevalence:
AIDS has become a global pandemic, affecting millions of people worldwide. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), as of 2020, approximately 38 million people were living with HIV/AIDS globally. Since the onset of the epidemic, an estimated 76 million people have been infected with HIV, and around 36 million people have succumbed to AIDS-related illnesses.

Transmission Routes:
HIV can be transmitted through various routes, including:

1. Sexual Contact: Engaging in unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an infected person can lead to HIV transmission, especially if there are open sores, wounds, or the presence of other sexually transmitted infections.

2. Blood Contact: Sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or any other equipment for injecting drugs; needlestick injuries; and transfusion of infected blood or blood products (which is rare in countries with blood screening practices) can lead to HIV transmission.

3. Mother-to-Child Transmission: HIV can be passed from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. However, interventions such as antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs have significantly reduced the transmission rate.

4. Occupational Exposure: Healthcare workers are at risk of HIV transmission through needlestick injuries or contact with bodily fluids. However, the risk is relatively low due to the universal precautions and preventive measures employed in healthcare settings.

Major Risk Factors:
Various factors contribute to HIV transmission and the risk of developing AIDS:

1. Unprotected Sexual Intercourse: Engaging in sexual activities without using condoms or barriers increases the risk of HIV transmission, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of HIV.

2. Injection Drug Use: Sharing needles, syringes, or drug paraphernalia can lead to direct blood contact and increase the risk of HIV transmission.

3. Lack of HIV Knowledge and Awareness: Limited understanding of HIV, its transmission routes, and preventive measures can contribute to higher rates of transmission.

4. Poverty and Inequality: Socioeconomic factors often create an environment where individuals may be more vulnerable to HIV infection, such as limited access to healthcare, education, and prevention services.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of AIDS varies across different regions and populations. Sub-Saharan Africa has been disproportionately affected, accounting for approximately 67% of all people living with HIV globally. Within this region, certain countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Uganda have high prevalence rates.

Other regions heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS include Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean. In some countries, marginalized populations such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender individuals, and people who inject drugs face a higher risk of infection due to societal stigma, discrimination, and limited access to healthcare services.

Significant progress has been made in recent years in reducing the global prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Increased access to antiretroviral therapy, expanded prevention efforts including condom distribution and harm reduction programs, and advancements in maternal and child health have all contributed to lowering infection rates. However, continued efforts in prevention, treatment, and reducing societal barriers are crucial to further combat the AIDS epidemic.

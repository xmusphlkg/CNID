Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious viral infection characterized by the sudden onset of redness, swelling, and discharge in the conjunctiva of the eye. It is caused by several types of viruses, primarily Enterovirus 70 (EV70) and Coxsackievirus A24 (CA24).

Historical Context and Discovery:
The first description of AHC was in 1969 during an outbreak in Ghana, Africa. It later spread to other parts of Africa and then to Asia. The pandemic nature of AHC was recognized in the 1970s when it rapidly circulated in various regions worldwide. Since then, AHC outbreaks have been reported in many countries, with varying levels of severity.

Prevalence:
AHC is prevalent globally, but its impact varies among different regions and populations. Outbreaks have been reported in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania. The incidence of AHC is typically higher in tropical and subtropical regions due to favorable environmental conditions for viral transmission.

Transmission Routes:
AHC is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected ocular secretions or contaminated surfaces. The virus can be present in tears, nasal secretions, and feces of infected individuals. Transmission can occur through hand-to-eye contact, sharing contaminated objects such as towels or eye drops, and exposure to respiratory droplets generated by infected individuals through coughing or sneezing.

Affected Populations:
AHC can affect individuals of all ages and demographics. However, certain populations are more susceptible to infection. Young children, especially those attending daycare facilities or schools, are at a higher risk due to close contact. Additionally, individuals with poor hygiene practices, such as inadequate handwashing, are more vulnerable to AHC.

Key Statistics:
Exact global statistics for AHC are challenging to determine, as many cases go unreported or are misdiagnosed. However, outbreaks have been reported intermittently in many countries. During outbreaks, AHC can affect a significant number of individuals within a short period. In densely populated areas, the spread of AHC can be rapid, leading to substantial morbidity.

Risk Factors:
Several risk factors contribute to the transmission of AHC. These include overcrowded living conditions, poor sanitation, lack of access to clean water, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, behaviors such as close contact with infected individuals, lack of hand hygiene, and sharing personal items increase the risk of AHC transmission.

Impact on Regions and Populations:
The impact of AHC varies geographically. In some regions, AHC may occur sporadically or as localized outbreaks, primarily affecting specific communities or institutions. However, in other regions, widespread outbreaks can occur, resulting in significant morbidity and strain on healthcare systems.

In developing countries with limited resources and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, AHC outbreaks can have a severe impact. They can impose a considerable burden on healthcare facilities that are already managing other infectious diseases. Additionally, productivity loss due to illness or caring for affected individuals can have economic consequences for affected populations.

Variations in prevalence rates and affected demographics can be observed within regions. Factors such as population density, healthcare access, and socio-economic conditions contribute to these variations. Targeted public health interventions and improved hygiene practices can help mitigate the impact of AHC and reduce transmission rates.

Overall, AHC remains a significant public health concern, particularly in regions with lower socio-economic status and limited resources. Continued surveillance, early detection, and timely implementation of control measures are necessary to minimize the spread and impact of this viral infection.
## Introduction

Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious viral infection primarily affecting the conjunctiva and eyelids. Originating from enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24, typical symptoms may include sudden onset of eye pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes subconjunctival hemorrhage. Outbreaks usually happen on a community-wide scale, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. No specific antiviral treatment exists for AHC; management involves supportive care and prevention of transmission.
## Highlights

1. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis has demonstrated significant seasonality, with a notable spike in cases annually around September.<br/>
2. While no deaths have been recorded for most months, sporadic fatalities in December 2011, August 2019, and February 2020 indicate a potential for severity.<br/>
3. The count of cases in September 2023 skyrocketed to 125,264, representing an unprecedented surge compared to previous years.<br/>
4. Despite seasonal peaks, a substantial overall decreasing trend was observed from 2010-2022. However, this changed drastically in 2023 with a sudden increase starting from June.<br/>
5. There's an urgent need for increased public health measures, notably in late summer and early fall, to manage and mitigate this disease's impact.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Analyzing Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) case data from 2010 to 2023 in mainland China, we observed cyclic trends in the data. Most cases occurred between the months of July to September peaking generally in September. The highest surge was in September 2010 with 48,658 cases and lately in September 2023 with a whopping 125,264 cases. The annual cases showed an overall increasing trend despite few dips, hinting towards a complex epidemiologic behavior of the AHC virus.

### Deaths Analysis
The death analysis indicates a relatively low lethality rate of AHC in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. There were only four reported deaths throughout the whole period: December 2011, August 2019, and February 2020. This reinforces the fact that AHC, an infectious eye disease, although may cause considerable discomfort, is rarely lethal. Nonetheless, it remains a public health concern due to its potential complications and rapid spread.

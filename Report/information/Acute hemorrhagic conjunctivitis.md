Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), also known as epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, is a highly contagious eye infection that primarily affects the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids. AHC is caused by several types of viruses, with Enterovirus 70 (EV70) and Coxsackievirus A24 (CA24) being the most common culprits.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis was first recognized and described in Ghana in 1969 during an outbreak. It quickly spread to other parts of West Africa and subsequently to other regions, becoming a global health concern. The virus responsible for AHC was isolated in 1970, and since then, numerous outbreaks have been reported worldwide.

Global Prevalence:
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis has a global distribution and has been reported in various countries across all continents. Outbreaks of AHC occur sporadically, often in epidemic form, particularly in densely populated areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices. The prevalence varies from year to year and between different regions.

Transmission Routes:
AHC is primarily transmitted through direct contact with the discharge from infected individuals' eyes or hands. The virus can also spread indirectly through contaminated objects, such as towels, tissues, and shared personal items. Poor hand hygiene and close contact with infected individuals increase the risk of transmission.

Affected Populations:
AHC can affect individuals of all age groups, but it is more commonly seen in children and young adults. Crowded living conditions, such as schools, dormitories, military barracks, and childcare centers, facilitate the rapid spread of the infection. People with weakened immune systems or pre-existing eye conditions are also more susceptible to AHC.

Key Statistics:
Exact data on the prevalence of AHC is challenging to obtain due to underreporting and variations in surveillance systems. However, outbreaks have been reported in several countries, including China, Japan, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Brazil, Egypt, and the United States. During epidemics, thousands of cases can occur within a short period. Mortality due to AHC is rare, but the infection can cause significant morbidity and discomfort.

Major Risk Factors:
Several risk factors contribute to the transmission of AHC, including:

1. Poor hygiene practices: Lack of proper handwashing and personal hygiene increases the risk of infection.
2. Crowded living conditions: Close contact with infected individuals in crowded settings facilitates transmission.
3. Contaminated objects: Sharing towels, eye cosmetics, or other personal items can spread the virus.
4. Lack of immunization: Absence of specific vaccines against AHC leaves populations susceptible to outbreaks.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of AHC varies across regions, depending on the level of healthcare infrastructure, public health measures, and surveillance systems in place. Developing countries, particularly those with inadequate sanitation and hygiene facilities, often experience larger outbreaks and higher prevalence rates. In densely populated areas, the virus can spread rapidly, affecting a significant portion of the population. Outbreaks can disrupt daily activities, including schools, workplaces, and public gatherings.

In conclusion, Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious eye infection caused by various viruses. It affects all age groups, with children and young adults being more commonly affected. AHC is transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected individuals or contaminated objects. The prevalence and impact of AHC vary across different regions, with outbreaks occurring sporadically and more frequently in areas with poor sanitation and crowded living conditions.

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), also known as epidemic conjunctivitis or pink eye, is a highly contagious eye infection caused by certain strains of enteroviruses, specifically the coxsackievirus A24 variant and the enterovirus 70. AHC primarily affects the conjunctiva, which is the thin, transparent tissue that covers the white part of the eye and lines the inner surface of the eyelids.

Global Prevalence and Transmission Routes:
AHC can occur sporadically or in outbreaks and has been reported in various parts of the world. Determining the precise global prevalence of AHC is challenging due to underreporting and variations in surveillance systems. Outbreaks tend to occur in densely populated areas such as schools, universities, military barracks, and refugee camps, where the virus can easily spread through person-to-person contact.

AHC is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected eye secretions, contaminated objects, or contaminated hands. The virus can also spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Poor hand hygiene and crowded living conditions increase the risk of transmission.

Affected Populations:
AHC can affect individuals of all ages, but children, adolescents, and young adults are more susceptible due to lower immunity, increased contact with others in school or social settings, and poor compliance with preventive measures.

Key Statistics:
The incidence of AHC varies widely between outbreaks and regions. During outbreaks, reported attack rates have ranged from 1% to 50%, depending on the contagiousness of the specific strain involved, the population's susceptibility, and the effectiveness of implemented control measures.

Historical Context and Discovery:
AHC first gained recognition during an outbreak in Ghana and Singapore in 1969. The specific virus causing AHC was not identified until the 1970s when researchers successfully isolated the coxsackievirus A24 strain. Since then, multiple outbreaks have been reported in various countries, including China, India, Japan, Malaysia, the United States, and several African and South American nations.

Major Risk Factors:
- Close contact with infected individuals, particularly through direct eye contact or sharing contaminated objects.
- Poor hand hygiene practices, including inadequate handwashing or failure to use hand sanitizers.
- Crowded living or working conditions, such as schools, dormitories, military camps, or refugee camps.
- Lack of access to healthcare or limited availability of preventive measures.
- Lack of awareness about AHC and its modes of transmission.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of AHC can vary between regions and populations due to differences in healthcare infrastructure, preventive measures, and population susceptibility. Outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries with limited resources can lead to significant morbidity and economic burdens, especially in areas lacking healthcare and eye care services.

In developed countries, although AHC outbreaks are relatively rare, they can still occur, particularly in closed settings or when infected individuals come into contact with susceptible populations. The impact is typically more manageable due to better healthcare infrastructure, early detection, and the availability of appropriate treatments.

Variations in prevalence rates and affected demographics can also be observed within regions and communities. Factors such as cultural practices, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare can influence the susceptibility and impact of AHC.

In conclusion, Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious eye infection caused by enteroviruses. Its global prevalence varies due to underreporting and variations in surveillance systems. AHC primarily spreads through direct contact with infected eye secretions or contaminated objects. Children and young adults are more susceptible, and risk factors include close contact, poor hand hygiene, and crowded environments. The impact of AHC can vary between regions and populations, with potentially greater morbidity in areas with limited healthcare resources.

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is an infectious eye disease characterized by painful swelling of the eyelids, watery discharge from the eyes, and subconjunctival hemorrhages, which give the condition its name. It is highly contagious and can cause outbreaks, especially in tropical and subtropical climates. Here, I'll provide an overview of the epidemiology of AHC based on data available up to my last update in April 2023.

**Global Prevalence and Historical Context:**
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis was first identified in Ghana in 1969, and by the 1970s, it had spread to other countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific Islands. Global prevalence is difficult to estimate due to variations in outbreak intensity, affected regions, and surveillance quality. Outbreaks can occur sporadically, and a high incidence is often reported in communities where the virus is introduced.

**Etiology:**
AHC is caused primarily by two types of enteroviruses: Enterovirus 70 (EV-70) and Coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v). Both viruses are members of the Picornaviridae family. 

**Transmission Routes:**
Direct contact with conjunctival secretions, touch (including hand-to-eye contact), and fomites (objects or materials likely to carry infection) are the most common transmission routes for AHC. The virus has the potential to spread rapidly in crowded settings, and large-scale outbreaks have been observed in the past.

**Affected Populations:**
Individuals of all ages can be affected by AHC, but the disease incidence can be higher among children and young adults due to their close-contact activities and less developed hygiene practices. Health care settings and schools are common sites of outbreaks owing to the density of susceptible individuals and potential for close contact.

**Key Statistics and Impact:**
Statistics on AHC can vary widely between regions and outbreaks, but during epidemic periods, attack rates can be high, with a significant proportion of a susceptible population developing symptoms. Despite its alarming symptoms, AHC typically has a benign course, resolving within one to two weeks without long-term visual sequelae. However, the discomfort and temporary visual impairment can have socio-economic consequences, such as missed work or school days.

**Major Risk Factors:**
The major risk factors associated with AHC transmission include:

- Close personal contact with an infected individual
- Poor hand hygiene practices
- Overcrowded living conditions
- Visiting or working in healthcare settings without proper infection control practices
- Sharing personal items such as towels, washcloths, or eye makeup that may be contaminated

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
The impact of AHC varies by geographic location, with subtropical and tropical areas experiencing more frequent outbreaks. Socio-economic factors often influence the spread, where populations with limited access to clean water and healthcare are at a higher risk of sustained transmission.

In terms of demographics, children and young adults may be disproportionately affected in outbreaks due to the reasons mentioned above. However, no age group is immune, and adults including the elderly can contract AHC during epidemics.

**Preventive Measures:**
Prevention strategies focus on hygiene education, such as handwashing and avoiding touching the eyes. During outbreaks, public health measures may include isolating affected individuals, discouraging the sharing of personal items, and sometimes closing schools or other institutions to control the spread of the virus.

In summary, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is an epidemic eye disease that can spread rapidly under certain conditions. Despite its usually self-limiting nature, the discomfort and potential for widespread transmission make it a significant public health concern, especially in certain geographical regions. Combatting AHC effectively calls for a multifaceted approach involving public health education, improved hygiene practices, and vigilant surveillance during outbreaks.

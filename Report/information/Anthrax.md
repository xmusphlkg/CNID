Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is a zoonotic disease with both human and animal health implications. This comprehensive overview examines the epidemiology of Anthrax, encompassing global prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, historical context, and discovery. Additionally, it highlights major risk factors associated with the transmission of Anthrax and explores its impact on various regions and populations.

Anthrax occurs worldwide, although its prevalence varies among different regions. It is particularly common in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East where the disease is endemic. Nevertheless, sporadic cases and outbreaks can manifest in any part of the world.

Transmission of Anthrax primarily occurs in animals and can present in three main forms: cutaneous, inhalational, and gastrointestinal. Direct contact with infected animals, consumption of contaminated animal products, or inhalation of spores are the means by which humans acquire the disease. Inhalational Anthrax, although rare, is the most severe form and typically occurs when handling infected animal carcasses or contaminated animal products.

Both animals and humans are susceptible to Anthrax. In animals, a broad range of species is affected, including livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats), wildlife (deer and antelope), and occasionally domestic pets. Humans who work closely with animals, such as farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers, face a higher risk. However, anyone can be at risk if exposed to contaminated animals or animal products.

While limited, global data suggests an estimated 20,000-100,000 human Anthrax cases occur annually worldwide. Mortality rates depend on the form of the disease and access to healthcare. Inhalational Anthrax, the most severe form, has a case fatality rate of approximately 75% without treatment.

Anthrax's history dates back centuries. Its significance rose in the 19th century when the causative agent, Bacillus anthracis, was identified. A major breakthrough occurred when Louis Pasteur developed an Anthrax vaccine in the late 1800s. This discovery paved the way for the development of vaccines and control measures that have greatly diminished the impact of Anthrax today.

Direct contact with infected animals or animal products, consumption of inadequately cooked contaminated meat, occupational exposure to livestock or their products, and working in specific industries like agriculture and animal husbandry are the major risk factors associated with Anthrax transmission.

Anthrax prevalence rates may vary across regions due to climate, agricultural practices, animal husbandry methods, and healthcare infrastructure. Those regions with higher livestock populations and limited veterinary services face an increased risk. Socioeconomic factors also play a role, as poorer populations with limited access to healthcare and proper livestock management are more vulnerable.

In conclusion, Anthrax is a globally present zoonotic disease with varying prevalence rates across different regions. It primarily affects animals and is transmitted to humans through direct contact or consumption of contaminated animal products. Occupational exposure to livestock is a significant risk factor. Although Anthrax has historically posed notable health risks, the development of vaccines and control measures has contributed to its decline. Efforts to improve animal health, livestock management, and public health infrastructure are crucial for further reducing the impact of Anthrax on various regions and populations.
## Introduction

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis. The spores of these bacteria can live in soil for many years, and humans can get anthrax from exposure to infected animals, wool, meat, or hide. The disease can manifest in three forms: cutaneous (skin), inhalation, and gastrointestinal. Symptoms vary by type but can include skin ulcers, fever, chest discomfort, and severe diarrhea. Vaccines are available but often reserved for the individuals at higher risk. Prompt treatment is critical; if left untreated, anthrax can be fatal.
## Highlights

1. A surge in anthrax cases observed during the summer (June to August), with the highest recorded in August 2023.<br/>2. Despite considerable fluctuation in case numbers, there's an overall trend of growth across the years.<br/>3. Mortality remains generally low but inconsistent; however, September 2023 reported a death.<br/>4. Cases in September are higher compared to previous months, suggesting persistent transmission. The trend demands proactive measures.<br/>5. Overall, despite the growth, prompt diagnosis and treatment might be reducing the mortality rate.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reflects a clear annual cycle for Anthrax cases in mainland China. The incidence typically increases between May and August with decreases during the rest of the year. The number of cases annually seems to fluctuate, the lowest around 2013 while highest peaks observed in 2021 and 2023 in August. It seems that the infection rate goes high during warmer months, potentially due to increased human-animal interaction or changes in the environment making it more conducive to bacteria. Comparatively, winter months have fewer case occurrences.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to Anthrax are relatively fewer and the pattern seems somewhat random with no clear monthly or annual trend. The total number of deaths remained constant or sometimes zero, indicating that most cases might be diagnosed and managed correctly to prevent fatalities. Furthermore, unlike the cases, the deaths do not appear to increase in warmer months, suggesting that while infection rates might be higher, fatalities may not correlate directly with the incidence of the disease.

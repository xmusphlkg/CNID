Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It primarily affects wild and domesticated herbivorous mammals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, camels, antelopes, and other herbivores, but it can also infect humans. While anthrax is most common in agricultural regions in Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, central and southwestern Asia, southern and eastern Europe, and the Caribbean, it can occur globally.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Anthrax is among the oldest recorded diseases affecting livestock, with descriptions dating back to biblical times. Itâ€™s believed that the fifth and sixth plagues described in the Book of Exodus could have been anthrax. Historically, anthrax was a significant cause of mortality in livestock, and it has also had profound impacts on human populations that engage in animal husbandry. The disease was studied intensively in the 19th century, contributing to the development of the germ theory of disease. The causative agent, Bacillus anthracis, was discovered by Robert Koch in 1876, making anthrax the first bacterial disease for which a causative agent was identified.

**Global Prevalence and Transmission Routes:**
The global prevalence of anthrax is unevenly distributed, with sporadic outbreaks occurring in the aforementioned endemic regions. The bacteria produce highly resistant spores when exposed to harsh conditions, allowing them to survive in the environment for long periods, often decades. These spores can be found in soil and commonly infect animals when they graze or consume contaminated plants and water.

Transmission routes for humans include:
1. **Cutaneous Anthrax**: The most common form, where spores enter through cuts or abrasions in the skin, typically when handling infected animals or animal products.
2. **Inhalation Anthrax**: Occurs when airborne spores are inhaled. This is the most severe form and was a major concern during bioterrorism attacks, such as the 2001 anthrax letters in the US.
3. **Gastrointestinal Anthrax**: Results from ingesting undercooked or raw meat from infected animals.
4. **Injection Anthrax**: Though rare, it can occur through injecting drugs that are contaminated with anthrax spores.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics:**
Anthrax primarily affects populations involved with livestock and animal products, such as farmers, veterinarians, and industrial workers processing wool, hides, and bones. Cases in the general population are much rarer. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there are 20,000 to 100,000 cases of cutaneous anthrax worldwide each year, with case fatality rates between 20% and 80% for untreated inhalational and gastrointestinal anthrax, respectively, while cutaneous anthrax has a fatality rate of less than 1% if treated.

**Major Risk Factors:**
Key risk factors for anthrax include:
- Occupational exposure to infected animals or contaminated animal products.
- Working or living in an area where anthrax is endemic.
- Bioterrorism exposure, as anthrax spores can be weaponized into a fine powder that can be dispersed into the air.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
Prevalence rates and the impact of anthrax vary significantly across different regions. In endemic countries with limited veterinary and human public health infrastructure, outbreaks are more common, and anthrax poses significant economic and health challenges. These areas often lack the resources for extensive vaccination programs for livestock and the surveillance systems necessary to quickly identify and control outbreaks. Conversely, in developed countries, anthrax is rare, and the public health focus is more on preventing bioterrorism-related cases and ensuring a rapid response capability.

**Affected Demographics:**
Populations in close contact with potential sources of infection, including veterinarians, agricultural workers, and laboratory personnel handling anthrax samples, are at the highest risk. In regions where meat inspection and proper cooking practices are not standard, the risk of gastrointestinal anthrax can be higher among the general population.

While B. anthracis can infect anyone, the impact of the disease on different demographics usually reflects occupational exposures and lifestyle factors tied to the handling and consumption of animal products. In addition, certain socio-economic factors like poverty, instability, and lack of healthcare access can exacerbate the challenges of managing anthrax outbreaks in some regions.

**Conclusion:**
Efforts to control and prevent anthrax focus on vaccination of livestock in endemic areas, controlling animal movements to prevent spread, safe handling procedures for animal products, and educating at-risk populations on prevention strategies. With proper treatment, most forms of anthrax can be managed effectively, so early detection and response are critical. International health organizations work to support disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, and emergency preparedness worldwide to reduce the burden of anthrax and protect at-risk populations.

Epidemiology of Brucellosis:

Brucellosis, also known as Malta fever, Mediterranean fever, or undulant fever, is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacteria of the genus Brucella. It primarily affects animals, particularly livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. However, humans can also contract the disease through contact with infected animals or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products.

Global Prevalence:
Brucellosis is considered a major public health concern in many parts of the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that around half a million cases of human brucellosis occur annually worldwide. However, due to underreporting and limited surveillance systems, the actual number of cases is likely much higher.

Transmission Routes:
The main modes of transmission of Brucellosis to humans include direct contact with infected animals, such as handling fetal tissues, placenta, or other birth products, or ingestion of contaminated animal products like unpasteurized milk or cheese. Inhalation of infectious aerosols may also contribute to the spread of the disease, particularly in occupational settings such as slaughterhouses or laboratories.

Affected Populations:
Brucellosis can affect individuals of all ages and genders. Certain occupations, such as farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and laboratory personnel, are at a higher risk of contracting the disease due to their frequent exposure to infected animals or samples. Moreover, people living in rural or agricultural areas with close contact with animals are also vulnerable to Brucellosis.

Key Statistics:
The exact number of Brucellosis cases varies globally. However, it is more commonly reported in regions where livestock farming is prevalent, such as the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America, and certain parts of Asia. In these regions, the reported annual incidence can range from 10 to 200 cases per 100,000 population.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Brucellosis was first discovered and described by Sir David Bruce, a British physician, in Malta in 1886. He identified a cluster of cases among British soldiers and attributed it to the consumption of contaminated goat milk. Since then, other species of Brucella have been identified, including B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, each associated with different animal hosts and transmission patterns.

Major Risk Factors:
Several risk factors contribute to the transmission of Brucellosis. These include direct contact with animals or their bodily fluids, consumption of raw or unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals, occupational exposure in high-risk industries, and living in areas with a high prevalence of the disease.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The regional impact of Brucellosis varies due to differences in livestock farming practices, diagnostic capabilities, awareness, and control measures. For instance, in areas where livestock production is a crucial component of the economy, such as certain countries in the Middle East and Africa, the disease burden is often higher. Moreover, marginalized populations, such as refugees or inhabitants of resource-limited communities, may experience increased vulnerability due to limited healthcare facilities and poor livestock management practices.

Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:
Brucellosis prevalence rates differ among populations and regions. For example, in the Mediterranean basin and Middle Eastern countries, B. melitensis is the most common species causing human infection, primarily transmitted through sheep and goats. On the other hand, B. abortus is more prevalent in regions where cattle farming is prominent, like parts of South and Central America.

In conclusion, Brucellosis is a significant global health concern, primarily affecting individuals with occupational exposure to animals or consumption of contaminated animal products. Its impact varies across regions, with higher prevalence rates found in areas with intensive livestock farming. Effective control strategies, including improved animal health management, vaccination programs, and education regarding food safety and hygienic practices, are crucial to reducing the burden of Brucellosis worldwide.
## Introduction

Brucellosis, also known as Malta fever, is a highly contagious zoonotic infection caused by the bacteria of the genus Brucella. It primarily affects animals including cattle, goats, and pigs, with humans contracting the disease via unpasteurized dairy products or by close contact with infected animals. Symptoms range from fever, fatigue, muscle pain, to more serious complications like inflammation of the heart or nervous system. Although it can be severe or even fatal, brucellosis is typically treatable using a course of antibiotics.

## Highlights

1. The data reveals a clear yearly cyclic pattern in Brucellosis cases, peaking in summer and declining towards winter.<br/>2. Fatalities remain exceptionally low despite fluctuations in case numbers, indicating effective disease management.<br/>3. Brucellosis cases are on a subtle rise through the years since 2010, signaling a need for enhanced preventive measures.<br/>4. Notably, in September 2023, 5987 cases and 2 fatalities were reported, reflecting a downward trend after the peak in July 2023 and emphasizing the aforementioned yearly pattern.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
An analysis of the brucellosis cases shows a generally increasing trend from 2010 to 2023, with marked peaks mostly during summer â€“ May to August (possibly due to higher bacterial activity in warmer months). A notable dip in cases is seen in 2020 February, possibly due to COVID-19 impacts. However, cases seem to spike again commencing from 2021. Interestingly, the highest number of cases was reported in June 2022, about 9943, indicating an escalating infection rate in the recent past.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the rising cases, deaths remain sporadic and relatively infrequent for Brucellosis, reinforcing the fact that it's typically not a fatal disease. The highest number of deaths in a month, 2, is reported three times: July 2018, July 2021, and September 2023. Year 2023 depicts an increased death rate compared to previous years, which might indicate an increasing severity of infection or possible reporting biases. However, overall mortality remains low despite the rising case count.

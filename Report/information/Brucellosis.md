Brucellosis, also known as Malta fever or undulant fever, is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella. The disease primarily affects various species of domesticated animals, including goats, sheep, cattle, pigs, and dogs, and can also infect wildlife. Humans typically acquire the infection through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids or by consuming contaminated animal products.

**Global Prevalence and Transmission Routes**

Brucellosis is considered one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases globally, with cases reported from all continents except Antarctica. Regions with high agricultural activity where domestic animals are raised, such as the Mediterranean Basin, Central Asia, parts of Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, tend to report higher incidences of the disease.

Transmission to humans can occur through several routes:
- Consuming raw milk or cheese from infected animals.
- Direct contact with bodily fluids (blood, semen, placental fluids) or tissues of infected animals, which is a significant risk for those working in slaughterhouses or veterinary settings.
- Inhalation of aerosols, which is particularly a concern in laboratory environments.
- Rarely, through human-to-human transmission via breastfeeding or transplacentally from mother to fetus.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics**

The disease has a profound impact on rural communities where livestock farming is a significant means of livelihood. Individuals at the highest risk of infection include:
- Farmers and ranchers
- Veterinary professionals
- Slaughterhouse workers
- Laboratory technicians who handle Brucella cultures
- Individuals consuming unpasteurized dairy products

While brucellosis is not high in mortality, it can cause substantial morbidity, leading to intermittent fevers, joint pain, fatigue, and various organ system complications if not properly treated.

**Historical Context and Discovery**

The disease has been recognized since ancient times, with Hippocrates describing a similar condition as early as 460 BC. The discovery of Brucellosis as a bacterium, however, did not occur until the 19th century. In 1887, the British army surgeon David Bruce identified the causative agent of Malta fever in soldiers stationed in Malta. The disease was eventually named after him. Later, the connection between infected animals and human disease was established, leading to better control and prevention measures.

**Major Risk Factors**

Major risk factors for brucellosis transmission include:
- Occupational exposure: Handling animals or animal tissues without proper protective equipment.
- Consumption of unpasteurized milk, cheese, and dairy products.
- Lack of control programs for animal health, resulting in a higher prevalence of infection in livestock.
- Poor food-handling practices and insufficient education on the risks of raw dairy products.
- Inadequate veterinary and public health infrastructure, especially in developing regions, impedes surveillance and control efforts.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations**

The prevalence of brucellosis varies considerably between regions due to differences in animal husbandry practices, consumption of animal products, and public health policies. In high-income countries, brucellosis has been significantly reduced through animal vaccination programs, pasteurization of dairy products, and strict veterinary control measures. In contrast, in many low- and middle-income countries, the prevalence remains high due to limited resources for animal health and public education.

The disease disproportionately affects adults who are in their most productive years, leading to economic loss due to reduced labor capacity and increased healthcare costs. It also has implications for animal health and productivity, compounding the economic impact in agricultural sectors.

In conclusion, brucellosis remains a significant public health issue, particularly in parts of the world where animal husbandry is essential to the economy and where public health systems are less developed. Control measures, including vaccination of animals, pasteurization of dairy products, education, and occupational protective measures, are essential tools in reducing the prevalence and impact of this disease.

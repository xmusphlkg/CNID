Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, and it has been a longstanding public health concern worldwide, particularly in regions with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. The epidemiology of cholera is characterized by periodic outbreaks and endemicity in specific regions.

Historically, cholera has been documented as a disease dating back to ancient times. However, it was not until the 19th century that the connection between contaminated water and cholera transmission was discovered. In 1854, John Snow, an English physician, identified a specific well as the source of a cholera outbreak in London, providing strong evidence for the waterborne transmission of the disease.

Currently, cholera is endemic in many parts of the world, with periodic outbreaks occurring. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 million cholera cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths occur globally each year. However, these numbers are likely underestimated due to underreporting and limited surveillance in some countries.

The primary mode of transmission for cholera is through the ingestion of water or food contaminated with the feces of an infected individual. The bacterium Vibrio cholerae is commonly found in water sources contaminated with human feces, and it can survive in aquatic environments. Consuming uncooked or undercooked seafood from contaminated waters can also transmit the disease. Person-to-person transmission is rare but can occur in densely populated areas with poor sanitation.

Cholera affects individuals of all ages and genders, but certain populations are more vulnerable. This includes individuals living in poverty with limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Refugee camps, slums, and overcrowded areas with poor hygiene practices are particularly at high risk. Additionally, individuals with compromised immune systems, such as malnourished individuals or those with other underlying medical conditions, may be more susceptible to severe cholera infections.

Several risk factors contribute to the transmission of cholera. Poor sanitation, lack of clean water, and inadequate sanitation facilities are significant risk factors. Improper handwashing and hygiene practices also contribute to disease transmission. Climate-related factors, such as heavy rainfall and flooding, can exacerbate the spread of cholera by contaminating water sources. Furthermore, population displacement, poor healthcare infrastructure, and limited access to quality healthcare services can hinder prevention and control measures.

Cholera has a greater impact on regions with limited resources and infrastructure to control the disease. Sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia (including Bangladesh and India), and Haiti in the Americas have experienced significant cholera outbreaks in recent years. Additionally, during humanitarian crises, such as natural disasters or armed conflicts, the risk of cholera outbreaks increases due to disrupted water and sanitation systems.

The prevalence rates of cholera can vary across regions and populations. In high-risk areas, cholera can become endemic, with frequent outbreaks and ongoing transmission. For example, in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is endemic and occurs seasonally. These regions also face higher rates of severe cholera infections and associated mortality.

Demographically, cholera affects all age groups, but children under five years old are particularly vulnerable. This vulnerability is partly due to their weaker immune systems and increased susceptibility to complications related to dehydration. During outbreaks, cholera disproportionately affects marginalized and vulnerable populations, including those living in poverty and in areas with limited access to healthcare.

In conclusion, cholera remains a significant public health concern globally, with periodic outbreaks and endemicity in specific regions. Poor sanitation, inadequate access to clean water, and limited healthcare infrastructure are major risk factors associated with cholera transmission. The impact of cholera varies across different regions and populations, with higher prevalence rates and severe outcomes observed in areas with limited resources and infrastructure to control the disease. Efforts to improve sanitation, access to clean water, and promote hygiene practices are crucial for preventing and controlling cholera.
## Introduction

Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae bacteria, primarily transmitted via contaminated water and food. It presents with severe vomiting, rapid loss of body fluids leading to dehydration and shock. Prompt treatment with rehydration therapy can effectively manage cholera, though lack of immediate care can result in death. Prevention revolves around improved sanitation, safe water, and vaccines. The disease remains a global threat in areas with inadequate water and sanitation systems.

## Highlights

1. The cyclical pattern of increased Cholera cases during summer months (June-August) and a decrease in the colder season is sustained.<br/> 
2. Despite occasional spikes, the general trend over the past decade has shown a consistent decline in cases, with no significant increase in recent years.<br/>
3. September 2023 experienced a modest increase, marking it as the month with the highest number of cases of the year, although still in line with annual patterns.<br/>
4. Notably, despite several cases through the years, the fatality rate has remained relatively low, indicating effective disease management.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The reported Cholera cases from 2010 to 2023 in mainland China depict sporadic occurrence with certain seasonal pattern, as the number of reported cases tends to increase from May, peaking around August and then decreasing towards the December each year. The year 2010 records a significant peak for the decade with 63 cases in August and has been decreasing since, with minor surges observed in the subsequent years. However, the years 2011 to 2021 generally indicate a successful containment of Cholera, as case numbers remain low compared to 2010.

### Deaths Analysis

The data for deaths from 2010 to 2023 shows exceptionally effective management of Cholera in China as very few deaths occurred during the period. Out of 13 years data, only two deaths were reported in July and September 2013, respectively. This indicates that Cholera, despite its sporadic occurrence, was generally well-managed and didn't result in substantial fatalities in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. Receiving timely intervention and prevention can help control death rates in bacterial infections like Cholera.

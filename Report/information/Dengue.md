Dengue, caused by the dengue virus and transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti, is a highly significant mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide. It is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, primarily in urban and semi-urban areas.

Dengue has been a documented disease for centuries, with evidence suggesting its existence as far back as the 18th century. The first recorded epidemics occurred in the 1770s and 1780s in Asia, Africa, and North America. The term "dengue" originates from the Swahili phrase "Ka-dinga pepo," which means "cramp-like seizure caused by the evil spirit." In 1906, the role of Aedes mosquitoes in transmitting dengue was identified, and subsequent studies confirmed the presence of different serotypes of the dengue virus.

Dengue is endemic in over 100 countries, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, the Americas, Africa, and the Pacific. Annually, an estimated 390 million dengue infections occur, with approximately 96 million displaying clinical symptoms. The number of reported cases has surged in recent decades, posing a global health concern.

The primary mode of dengue transmission is through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. These mosquitoes thrive in urban and semi-urban areas, where they breed in standing water. Additionally, dengue can be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ transplants, or from mother to fetus during pregnancy.

Dengue affects people of all ages and genders, with individuals living in or traveling to dengue-endemic regions being at risk. However, severe forms of the disease are more likely to develop in children, infants, and pregnant women. Factors such as immune status and genetic predisposition can also influence susceptibility to severe dengue.

Several risk factors contribute to dengue transmission, including rapid urbanization, unplanned urban development, and inadequate sanitation, which promote the proliferation of Aedes mosquitoes. Climate change, resulting in warmer temperatures and increased rainfall, also facilitates mosquito breeding and subsequently higher transmission rates. International travel to dengue-endemic regions can introduce the virus to new areas, potentially triggering outbreaks. Challenges in vector control, such as insecticide resistance and ineffective measures, hinder efforts to control mosquito populations and prevent dengue transmission.

Dengue's impact varies across different regions, with the highest burden observed in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines report significant numbers of cases. Latin America and the Caribbean also experience high incidence rates. While dengue primarily affects people in urban and peri-urban areas with poor sanitation and limited access to reliable healthcare, outbreaks can occur in developed regions with efficient mosquito control due to the introduction of new virus serotypes.

Prevalence rates and affected demographics can vary within regions and countries, influenced by factors such as population density, climate, healthcare infrastructure, and socio-economic conditions.

In conclusion, dengue is a major global health concern with significant epidemiological implications. Its transmission by infected Aedes mosquitoes, combined with urbanization, climate change, and inadequate vector control, contribute to its widespread prevalence. Dengue affects people of all ages, with severe consequences for children, infants, and pregnant women. Understanding dengue's epidemiology is crucial for developing effective prevention and control strategies to mitigate its impact.
## Introduction

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral illness prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. It is caused by four serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4), creating potential for multiple infections in an individual's lifetime. Symptoms range from mild fever to severe dengue (also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever). While the majority of cases are non-severe, severe forms can result in shock, organ failure and death. Currently, treatment is primarily supportive, emphasizing the importance of early recognition and prompt clinical management.
## Highlights

1. Cases of Dengue sharply increase during warmer months, peaking in September (6494 cases in 2023), indicating that Dengue transmission is sensitive to climatic conditions.<br/>
2. There has been a significant increase in cases occurring in September since 2022, indicating a dangerous trend.<br/>
3. There was one death reported in September 2023, suggesting a high volume of severe cases.<br/>
4. The drastic rise in cases from June 2023 onwards calls for robust public health interventions.
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Dengue cases in mainland China show a clear seasonal variation with peaks during late summer to autumn (August to November). From 2010 to 2022, there's an increasing trend in the number of cases with drastic surges in 2014 and 2017. Notably, the single highest monthly case count (28,796) was observed in October 2014. In recent years (2020-2022), the case count has experienced a sharp decline, seemingly due to effective public health measures but shows a steep rise in 2023 with an upsurge highest since 2014.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths is relatively low with only eight incidents reported in the entire period, all occurring between 2012 and 2019. The death rate peaked in September 2014, with four reported deaths. After 2019, there have been no recorded deaths until one recorded in September 2023 which signals the potential severity of the dengue season of 2023. This data indicates a relatively low fatality rate but also the necessity of continuous surveillance and control measures.

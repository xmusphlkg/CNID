Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Highlighting the historical context first, diphtheria has been a recognized illness since ancient times, with descriptions that resemble its symptoms found in classical texts. The bacterium responsible for the disease was identified in the 1880s by two scientists, Friedrich Loeffler and Edwin Klebs.

**Historical Context:**
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, diphtheria was a significant cause of illness and death, especially among children. The development of the diphtheria antitoxin in the 1890s and later the introduction of an effective vaccine in the 1920s significantly reduced the incidence of the disease. Mass immunization led to a dramatic decline in cases in many parts of the world.

**Global Prevalence:**
Presently, due to widespread vaccination, diphtheria is relatively rare in developed nations. However, it remains a concern in some regions where immunization coverage is incomplete or where there are breaks in vaccination programs. Continuum pockets of diphtheritic infections are reported in parts of Asia, the South Pacific, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, and Africa.

**Transmission Routes:**
Diphtheria is primarily transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets, but it can also be contracted from close physical contact or from contaminated objects. The disease can also spread through cutaneous infections, although these infections do not usually cause the systemic effects seen in the respiratory variant. Asymptomatic carriers can also transmit the bacterium, which contributes to its spread.

**Affected Populations:**
While all age groups can be affected, unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated children are particularly at risk for diphtheria. Overcrowding, poor hygiene, and conditions that lead to a breakdown in health services can also increase the risk of transmission.

**Key Statistics:**
The mortality rate of diphtheria varies depending on treatment availability and the onset of symptoms but can be as high as 5-10% even with treatment. Without appropriate medical care, the fatality rate can be much higher.

**Major Risk Factors:**
The primary risk factor for diphtheria transmission is lack of vaccination or incomplete vaccination. Other risk factors include:
- Close contact with infected individuals or carriers
- Poor sanitation and crowded living conditions
- Travel to areas with endemic diphtheria
- Immunocompromised status
- Lack of access to medical care

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
The prevalence rates of diphtheria in regions with comprehensive vaccination programs are low. However, regions where conflict, economic constraints, or misinformation have disrupted public health measures see higher incidences of the disease. Demographics most affected in these regions are often children, particularly those under five, and individuals living in close quarters, such as in refugee camps or in areas with poor healthcare infrastructure.

In terms of recent outbreaks, countries such as India, Indonesia, and Yemen have seen spikes in diphtheria cases due to lapses in routine immunization. These outbreaks often serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage.

**Prevention:**
The diphtheria toxoid vaccine, which is often combined with vaccines for pertussis and tetanus (DTP series), is the primary mode of prevention. Maintaining high immunization rates is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease.

**Control and Treatment:**
When a case of diphtheria is detected, prompt administration of diphtheria antitoxin is required to neutralize the toxin produced by the bacteria, along with antibiotics like penicillin or erythromycin to eradicate the infection. Contact tracing and prophylactic treatment of close contacts are also essential in controlling an outbreak.

**Conclusion:**
Diphtheria was once a feared global killer but is now largely controlled in areas with effective vaccination programs. However, it remains a threat in some parts of the world, reinforcing the need for sustained public health efforts, including routine immunization, disease surveillance, and access to medical care for all populations.

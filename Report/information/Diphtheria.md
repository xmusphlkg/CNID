Diphtheria, caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, is a highly contagious respiratory infection. Although it primarily affects the upper respiratory tract, severe cases can result in systemic complications and death. This comprehensive overview examines the epidemiology of diphtheria, encompassing its global prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, historical context, discovery, major risk factors associated with transmission, and impact on various regions and populations.

Global Prevalence:
Diphtheria was previously a significant global public health concern, leading to widespread outbreaks and substantial morbidity and mortality. However, the introduction of effective vaccines has considerably reduced its incidence worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), only 13 cases of diphtheria were reported globally in 2019. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that the true burden of the disease may be underestimated due to underreporting and limited surveillance systems in certain regions.

Transmission Routes:
Diphtheria is primarily transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets from infected individuals, typically during close contact or exposure to respiratory secretions. Indirect transmission can also occur through contact with contaminated objects or surfaces. The incubation period for diphtheria is typically 2-5 days.

Affected Populations:
Diphtheria can affect anyone, but certain populations are at higher risk. Unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals, particularly children, are more susceptible to infection. People living in overcrowded conditions, such as refugee camps or high-density urban areas, are also at increased risk due to the easier transmission of the bacteria in such settings.

Key Statistics:
Prior to widespread immunization, diphtheria was a leading cause of death in children. WHO data indicates that globally, during the pre-vaccine era, the number of diphtheria cases peaked at approximately 100,000 per year in the 1920s. Mortality rates reached as high as 10%. However, routine vaccination programs have significantly reduced the incidence and mortality rates. As of 2019, globally reported cases of diphtheria have reached their lowest level in history.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Diphtheria has a long-standing history dating back centuries. Hippocrates first described the disease in ancient Greece around the 5th century BCE. However, significant advancements in understanding diphtheria occurred during the 19th century. In 1883, the German bacteriologist Edwin Klebs identified Corynebacterium diphtheriae as the causative agent of the disease. In 1888, Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin discovered the diphtheria toxin, which paved the way for the development of antitoxin treatments.

Major Risk Factors:
Several risk factors contribute to diphtheria transmission. The primary risk factor is inadequate immunization. Unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals, particularly in resource-limited settings, face a greater risk of contracting the disease. Lack of access to healthcare services, poor vaccination coverage, and low awareness about the importance of immunization all increase the likelihood of diphtheria transmission. Additional risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, living in crowded or unsanitary conditions, and poor personal hygiene practices.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of diphtheria varies across regions and populations. Prior to widespread vaccination, diphtheria was endemic in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries with limited healthcare infrastructure. While the incidence of diphtheria has significantly declined globally due to immunization efforts, certain countries and regions continue to experience sporadic outbreaks or epidemics. These outbreaks often occur in populations with low vaccination coverage or facing challenges in accessing healthcare services. Moreover, areas with humanitarian crises, such as conflict zones or refugee camps, face an increased risk due to the disruption of healthcare systems and overcrowded conditions.

In conclusion, diphtheria was once a major global public health concern. However, with the introduction of effective vaccines, its global prevalence has substantially reduced. The disease primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and disproportionately affects unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals, especially children. Major risk factors for transmission include inadequate immunization, close contact with infected individuals, and crowded living conditions. While the impact of diphtheria has been reduced globally, efforts must continue to ensure high vaccination coverage and strengthen healthcare systems in vulnerable populations and regions to prevent future outbreaks and maintain disease control.

Diphtheria, caused by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae, is a highly contagious infection primarily affecting the respiratory tract but also the skin. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of diphtheria.

Historical Context and Discovery: Diphtheria has been known since ancient times, with documented descriptions dating back to the 5th century BC. However, understanding its cause and transmission was limited until the late 19th century. In 1883, German bacteriologist Edwin Klebs identified the bacteria responsible for the disease, and in 1884, Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato discovered the diphtheria toxin. Their work led to the development of the first effective diphtheria vaccine in the 1920s.

Global Prevalence: Prior to widespread vaccination, diphtheria was a significant global health concern. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the disease caused severe illness and death in thousands of children each year. However, successful immunization campaigns have made diphtheria relatively rare in many parts of the world.

Transmission Routes: Diphtheria spreads through respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected individuals, or contact with contaminated objects or surfaces. The disease is most contagious during the first two weeks of illness, but individuals without symptoms can also transmit it.

Affected Populations: Diphtheria can affect individuals of all ages, but children under five and adults over 60 are particularly vulnerable. Those who are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated are also at higher risk.

Key Statistics: The incidence of global diphtheria has significantly decreased since the introduction of vaccination. In 2019, the WHO reported 16,651 cases worldwide, resulting in an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 deaths. However, these numbers may underestimate the true extent of the disease, especially in low-income countries with limited surveillance systems.

Major Risk Factors:
- Lack of Vaccination: Insufficient immunization coverage is the most significant risk factor for diphtheria transmission. Diphtheria vaccines are typically included in routine childhood immunization schedules in many countries.
- Low Socioeconomic Status: Poverty, inadequate health infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare can increase the risk of diphtheria transmission.
- Crowded Living Conditions: Close contact and overcrowded living spaces facilitate the spread of diphtheria, particularly in communities with low vaccination rates.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations: Diphtheria remains a significant public health concern in certain regions, particularly those with low vaccination coverage and limited healthcare infrastructure. Developing countries in Africa, Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe have reported higher incidence rates. Outbreaks can occur in crowded areas such as refugee camps and institutions with low vaccination rates.

Certain populations face higher risk due to specific circumstances. For instance, among refugees or displaced populations, the risk of diphtheria outbreaks increases due to crowded and unsanitary living conditions. Additionally, localized outbreaks can occur in areas with pockets of unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations, religious or philosophical objections to vaccination, and logistical challenges in reaching remote areas.

In conclusion, although diphtheria is now relatively rare globally, it still poses a significant risk in regions and populations with limited vaccination coverage and healthcare infrastructure. Vaccination remains the most effective preventive measure, and maintaining high immunization coverage and strengthening healthcare systems are essential for eradicating the disease worldwide.

Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The disease is characterized by sore throat, fever, and an adherent membrane on the tonsils, pharynx, and/or nasal cavity. Severe cases can lead to myocarditis, peripheral neuropathy, and respiratory failure.

**Historical Context and Discovery**

Diphtheria has been a recognized disease since ancient times, with descriptions dating back to the 5th century BC. However, its etiology was not understood until the 1880s when Edwin Klebs first identified the bacterium, and Friedrich Loeffler subsequently managed to isolate and culture it. Following these discoveries, Emil von Behring developed an antitoxin that became the standard treatment until the development of effective vaccines in the 1920s. The introduction of the diphtheria toxoid vaccine has led to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of the disease globally.

**Global Prevalence**

Diphtheria was once a common disease with frequent outbreaks, but its prevalence has significantly decreased due to widespread vaccination. Before routine vaccination, diphtheria caused devastating epidemics, mainly affecting children. Today, it is considered a rare disease in many parts of the world, particularly in countries with high vaccination coverage.

However, diphtheria is still endemic in some regions, particularly where vaccination coverage is incomplete or has lapsed. Countries in Africa, South Asia, and the former Soviet Union have reported cases in recent years. Additionally, in regions affected by conflict or instability, where healthcare infrastructure is compromised, diphtheria can re-emerge.

**Transmission Routes**

Corynebacterium diphtheriae is spread primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Contact with contaminated objects or surfaces can also transmit the bacteria. Carriers who show no symptoms can still spread the bacteria to others. Close contact and crowded living conditions facilitate the spread of diphtheria.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics**

Populations most affected by diphtheria are typically those with inadequate access to immunization services. Children, in particular, are vulnerable if they have not received the diphtheria vaccine or have not completed the full vaccination schedule. Reports of cases in adults have increased in some areas, likely due to waning immunity in individuals vaccinated many years ago and not receiving booster shots. Recent outbreaks in countries with lower vaccination rates have underscored the need for maintaining high immunization coverage.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported fluctuations in the number of diphtheria cases globally. For instance, during the period from 2004 to 2008, there were between 3,000 and 7,000 reported cases each year. However, due to under-reporting and surveillance issues, the actual numbers may be higher.

**Major Risk Factors**

- Lack of or incomplete vaccination.
- Close contact with an infected person or carrier.
- Poor hygiene and crowded living conditions.
- Travel to an area where diphtheria is endemic without proper immunization.
- Lack of timely treatment or access to medical care.

**Regional Impact**

Prevalence rates and affected demographics vary among regions. For example:

- In developed countries with high vaccination coverage, diphtheria is extremely rare. Cases may arise from travelers or immigrants from endemic regions.
- In developing countries, particularly those with inadequate healthcare infrastructure or where political and social unrest has disrupted vaccination programs, the incidence can be higher.
- Specific outbreaks, such as those in the former Soviet states following the collapse of the Soviet Union, highlight the importance of maintaining public health measures and immunization programs.

Effective vaccination campaigns and booster doses for adolescents and adults are critical control measures that continue to play a pivotal role in preventing the spread of diphtheria. Surveillance systems to detect and respond to cases promptly, along with public health education, are necessary to minimize the risk of diphtheria transmission and to reduce the impact of this potentially fatal disease.

Overall, the success of vaccination in controlling diphtheria demonstrates the effectiveness of coordinated public health initiatives. Continued vigilance, immunization coverage, and rapid response to potential outbreaks are crucial to keeping diphtheria at bay.

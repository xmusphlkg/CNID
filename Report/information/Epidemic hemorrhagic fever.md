Epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) is a viral disease characterized by fever, bleeding tendencies, and organ damage. It belongs to a group of viral hemorrhagic fevers, which also include diseases such as Ebola and Lassa fever. EHF is caused by several different viruses, including the Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. Each of these viruses has unique epidemiological characteristics, but collectively they contribute to the overall burden of EHF.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Epidemic hemorrhagic fever has been recognized for many years, although the specific viruses causing the disease were not identified until later. The first recorded outbreak of EHF occurred in 1967 in Marburg, Germany, where laboratory workers were infected with the Marburg virus after handling infected monkeys from Uganda. This event led to the discovery of the Marburg virus and recognition of EHF as a distinct disease. Subsequently, other viruses such as Ebola and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus were identified as causes of EHF.

Global Prevalence:
EHF has a global presence, although the specific viruses causing the disease are geographically constrained. Ebola virus outbreaks have primarily occurred in Central and West Africa, with notable outbreaks in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Marburg virus outbreaks have predominantly occurred in Africa, with outbreaks reported in Uganda, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is found in parts of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, with outbreaks reported in countries such as Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran.

Transmission Routes:
EHF viruses are zoonotic, originating in animals and transmissible to humans. The exact reservoir hosts for each virus may vary, but common animals include bats, primates, and rodents. Humans can acquire the virus through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids, such as blood or secretions. Additionally, human-to-human transmission can occur through contact with infected bodily fluids, including direct contact, sexual transmission, and contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. Healthcare workers are particularly at risk due to their close contact with infected individuals.

Affected Populations:
EHF can affect individuals of any age, gender, or socioeconomic status. However, certain populations may be at higher risk due to occupational exposure or living conditions. For example, individuals involved in hunting, animal husbandry, or healthcare are at increased risk of exposure to infected animals or patients. Lack of access to healthcare facilities or resources, poor infection control practices, and crowded living conditions can also contribute to the spread of EHF among vulnerable populations.

Key Statistics:
EHF outbreaks can vary in severity and impact. The fatality rates associated with different EHF viruses can range from 25% to over 90%. For example, the case fatality rate of the Ebola virus can exceed 70% in some outbreaks. The number of cases during an outbreak can also vary, with smaller localized outbreaks to larger epidemics impacting thousands of individuals. The overall burden of EHF on a global scale is relatively low compared to other infectious diseases, but outbreaks can have a profound impact on affected communities and healthcare systems.

Risk Factors:
Several risk factors are associated with the transmission of EHF. These can include proximity to specific animal reservoirs, such as bat caves, primate habitats, or rodent-infested areas. Engaging in activities that involve contact with animals or their products, such as hunting or butchering, can increase the risk of exposure. Additionally, inadequate infection control practices, including improper handling of biological samples or limited access to personal protective equipment, can contribute to the spread of EHF. Lack of public health infrastructure and resources to respond to outbreaks also exacerbates the risk.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
EHF outbreaks have had significant impacts on different regions and populations. In areas where healthcare infrastructure is weak, outbreaks can quickly overwhelm healthcare systems and lead to high mortality rates. These outbreaks also have wider socio-economic consequences, including disruption of trade, travel restrictions, and negative impacts on education and employment. EHF outbreaks also disproportionately affect marginalized populations, particularly those living in poverty or in areas with limited access to healthcare services. Women and children may also experience unique vulnerabilities during outbreaks, such as increased risks during pregnancy or challenges accessing healthcare.

Overall, EHF is an important public health concern with the potential for severe outbreaks and high mortality rates. Continued efforts in surveillance, prevention, and outbreak response are essential to minimize the impact of EHF on affected populations and prevent future outbreaks.
## Introduction

Epidemic hemorrhagic fever, also known as viral hemorrhagic fever, is an infectious disease characterized by fever and hemorrhaging. It's caused by several families of viruses, including Ebola and Dengue, among others. The disease can progress to severe illness or death due to the body's vascular system damage and the body's ability to regulate itself can deteriorate. The transmission of these viruses to humans can occur through contact with infected hosts or vectors, typically rodents or arthropods. Prevention and control are crucial to limit the spread of such viruses.
## Highlights

1. The reported cases of Epidemic hemorrhagic fever in China have been showing a declining trend over years since 2010. Especially from 2022 onward, confirmed cases decreased significantly indicating improved prevention measures.<br/>
2. The number of deaths each year reflects a similar trend with fewer deaths recorded in recent years. Specifically, in September 2023, only one death was reported.<br/>
3. The data points towards an annual pattern of an increase in cases in the colder months (November - January) suggesting a seasonal trend associated with the disease.<br/>
4. Despite the general decline, occasional spikes in cases such as those seen in November 2014, 2017, and 2021 suggest challenges in disease control.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever from 2010 to 2023 in mainland China reveals a cyclical pattern with cases generally peaking towards the end of the year, particularly in November and December. This trend appears more marked in the period from 2010 to 2021, with the highest number of reported cases in November 2012 (3000 cases). From the year 2022 onwards, the overall seasonal trend seems to weaken; however, the highest number of cases is still seen in the November of each year. The fluctuations in the number of cases could potentially be attributed to seasonal factors impacting the spread of the virus.

### Deaths Analysis
A similar cyclical pattern can be observed in death cases as well, with higher death numbers reported from November to December annually. Notably, there is an exceptional spike in September 2012 with 150 reported deaths, which sharply deviates from the consistent trend observed in the rest of the months and years. Generally, the fatality rate fluctuates and does not necessarily correspond to the number of cases. Nevertheless, despite seasonal variations, the number of deaths remains relatively low in comparison to the number of cases, suggesting a relatively low fatality rate for this disease.

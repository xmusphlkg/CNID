"Epidemic hemorrhagic fever" is a term that can refer to various viral diseases that cause hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, among others. Each of these diseases has a unique epidemiology, but they share some common characteristics, including symptoms of fever and bleeding and potential outbreaks that can be severe and hard to control. In this overview, I will cover some of the general aspects common to hemorrhagic fever viruses and then delve into specifics for some of these diseases.

**Global Prevalence and Historical Context**

Hemorrhagic fever viruses are distributed globally but are more common in specific regions where the natural reservoirs or vectors are found. For example, Ebola and Marburg viruses are mostly found in certain African countries, Lassa fever is endemic to West Africa, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is more widespread, occurring in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia.

These viruses often have a zoonotic origin, meaning that they can be transmitted from animals to humans. The discovery of these diseases often followed the occurrence of significant outbreaksâ€”for instance, the Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then, multiple outbreaks have provided insights into the disease's transmission and progression.

**Transmission Routes**

Transmission routes typically include:

- **Direct Contact**: Transmission often occurs through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected persons or animals, or with contaminated surfaces. This is common for the filoviruses like Ebola and Marburg.
  
- **Vectors**: For some hemorrhagic fevers like Yellow fever and Dengue, mosquitoes are the primary vectors.
  
- **Rodents**: Viruses like Lassa fever are commonly transmitted via contact with infected rodent excreta.

- **Ticks**: CCHF is primarily transmitted to people through bites from infected ticks, or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics**

The affected populations are usually those in close contact with the natural reservoir or vectors. For example, farming, hunting, and slaughtering of animals can put people at higher risk for zoonotic transmission. Health care workers are also at risk when caring for infected patients due to the potential for exposure to body fluids.

Statistics regarding these diseases fluctuate yearly and depend on outbreaks. For instance, as of my last update, the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak was the largest, resulting in more than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths.

**Major Risk Factors**

Risk factors associated with hemorrhagic fever viruses include:

- **Geographic location**: Living in or traveling to endemic areas.
  
- **Occupation**: Health care workers, farmers, hunters, and slaughterhouse workers are at higher risk.
  
- **Cultural practices**: Funeral practices involving contact with the deceased can spread infections.
  
- **Poor infection control practices**: Inadequate medical facilities or practices can facilitate the transmission, particularly in developing countries.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations**

The impact of these diseases can be profound, particularly in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. Outbreaks can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, economic disruption, and social upheaval. Some illnesses, like Ebola, primarily affect adults, while others, such as Dengue fever, can have higher prevalence rates in children in some settings.

**Variations in Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics**

Prevalence rates of hemorrhagic fever can show marked variation even within affected regions. Factors such as environmental changes, which can affect the distribution of reservoir animals or vectors, and human behavior significantly influence the spread and impact of these diseases. Demographically, while some diseases may affect individuals regardless of age or sex, there can be disparities based on occupation, socioeconomic status, and local customs.

**Prevention and Control**

Control measures are typically multifaceted and include:

- Improving surveillance and rapid identification of cases.
  
- Educating at-risk populations about transmission and prevention strategies.
  
- Implementing strict infection control measures in healthcare settings.
  
- Developing and distributing vaccines, where available (like the Ebola vaccine).
  
- Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission.
  
- Vector control measures in the case of vector-borne diseases.

**Conclusion**

Epidemic hemorrhagic fevers pose significant public health challenges due to their potential for high fatality rates, rapid transmission, and the difficulty of control. Ongoing monitoring, research, and international cooperation are crucial in managing and preventing outbreaks of these diseases.

For detailed, updated information and statistics, one would typically look to resources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and ongoing scientific research published in peer-reviewed journals.

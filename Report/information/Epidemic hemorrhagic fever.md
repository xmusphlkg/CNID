**Epidemiology of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever**

Epidemic hemorrhagic fever is not a single disease but a group of illnesses caused by several distinct families of viruses. Some of the most well-known types of hemorrhagic fever viruses include the Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), Lassa fever (Arenaviridae), and the hantaviruses (Bunyaviridae), among others.

**Global Prevalence:**
The prevalence of hemorrhagic fevers varies greatly by type and geography. For instance:

- Ebola and Marburg viruses have primarily affected populations in sub-Saharan Africa, with sporadic outbreaks recording high mortality rates.
- Lassa fever is endemic to parts of West Africa, with hundreds of thousands of infections annually.
- Hantavirus infections can be found worldwide but are more common in specific regions, such as in the Southwest United States, certain countries in South America, and areas in Europe and Asia.

**Transmission Routes:**
These viruses can be transmitted to humans through a variety of routes, depending on the specific virus:

- Direct contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons or animals.
- The bite or proximity to vector species (such as rodents and mosquitoes) that harbor the virus.
- Inhalation of aerosolized particles (notably seen with some types of hantaviruses).
- Laboratory accidents or improper handling of infected body fluids.
- Consuming contaminated food or food products.

**Affected Populations:**
Populations at risk are usually those in close contact with the virus's natural reservoir or those who enter endemic areas. Healthcare workers are also at risk if proper infection control measures are not practiced. Poverty, limited access to healthcare, and social and political unrest can exacerbate the spread of these diseases.

**Key Statistics:**
- Ebola outbreaks, such as the one in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, have shown case fatality rates as high as 40-90%, depending on the virus strain and the outbreak management.
- Lassa fever causes mild symptoms in about 80% of cases, but severe manifestations can occur in the remaining cases, with a fatality rate of about 1% overall.
- Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) has a mortality rate of about 36% in the Americas.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Diseases causing hemorrhagic fevers have existed for centuries, but scientific discovery happened much later. For example:

- The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 during simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (near the Ebola River).
- Lassa fever virus was discovered in 1969 when two missionary nurses died in Nigeria.
- Hantavirus was identified in 1978 among American and Korean soldiers during the Korean War, but it wasn't until 1993 that the Sin Nombre hantavirus was associated with HPS in the southwestern United States.

**Major Risk Factors:**
Risk factors associated with transmission include:

- Living in or visiting endemic areas.
- Working in occupations that expose individuals to potential vectors, such as agricultural, laboratory, or healthcare settings.
- Poor sanitary conditions that attract vector species.
- Certain cultural practices involving the handling of infected dead bodies (common in Ebola outbreaks).

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
Variations in prevalence rates and affected demographics are primarily determined by the local ecology of the vectors and reservoirs, climate conditions, and social factors. For instance:

- Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks are typically zoonotic spillovers attributed to direct interactions with wildlife or bats in Africa.
- Lassa fever prevalence is highest in rural West African communities where the Mastomys rodent species, which harbors the virus, is commonly found.
- Hantavirus infections typically occur in rural areas where humans may come into contact with rodent excreta.

To summarize, the epidemiology of hemorrhagic fevers is complex and multifaceted, intricately tied to ecological, social, and geographic factors. The prevalence of these diseases, their associated mortality rates, and the at-risk populations vary considerably around the world. Controlling the spread of hemorrhagic fevers requires understanding the local patterns of disease transmission and applying this knowledge to develop effective prevention and control strategies.

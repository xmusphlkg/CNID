Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious illness primarily affecting children, though it can also occur in adults. It's caused by a number of enteroviruses, most frequently the Coxsackie A16 virus and Enterovirus 71 (EV71), and to a lesser extent, other Coxsackieviruses and Enteroviruses.

**Global Prevalence:**
HFMD has a global presence with significant variation in prevalence between regions. It is endemic in many parts of Asia, where large outbreaks have been documented, especially in countries like China, Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia. The disease also occurs in the United States, Europe, and Australia, usually with seasonal patternsâ€”typically spring through fall in temperate climates and throughout the year in tropical areas. 

**Transmission Routes:**
The transmission of HFMD is primarily through direct contact with the nasal discharge, saliva, feces, or the blister fluid of an infected person. The disease can also spread by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. Enteroviruses that cause HFMD can persist in the environment and remain infectious on surfaces for several days under suitable conditions.

**Affected Populations:**
HFMD mainly affects infants and children younger than 5 years old due to their less mature immune systems and possibly due to lack of previous exposure to the viruses causing HFMD. However, older children, adolescents, and adults can also contract the disease. Infection provides immunity to the specific virus involved, but since HFMD can be caused by a variety of enteroviruses, it is possible to have the illness more than once.

**Key Statistics:**
The incidence of HFMD can vary substantially from year to year and from place to place. For example, in China, millions of cases are reported annually, with severe complications and even fatalities, primarily from complications associated with EV71. However, in the United States and other Western countries, most HFMD cases are relatively mild and severe complications are rare.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
HFMD was first reported in New Zealand in 1957. Since then, outbreaks have been reported worldwide. Over time, the role of different enterovirus serotypes in causing HFMD has been better understood. The development of molecular diagnostic methods has greatly improved the accuracy and speed of HFMD diagnosis.

**Major Risk Factors:**
- Young age, particularly children under 5 years old.
- Immunosuppression can increase susceptibility and severity.
- Exposure in communal settings, such as daycare centers and schools.
- Poor hand hygiene and sanitation practices.
- Close contact with an infected person.
  
**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
The burden of HFMD varies by region due to differences in circulating viral strains, population immunity, and public health measures. In Asia, particularly in China, HFMD can cause significant morbidity and mortality during outbreaks, with EV71 associated with more severe disease, including neurological complications like encephalitis, meningitis, and polio-like paralysis. In contrast, HFMD cases in North America and Europe are typically caused by Coxsackie A16, resulting in milder illness.

**Variations in Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:**
In Asia, the incidence of HFMD peaks in two age groups: toddlers aged 1-3 years and then in children 4-6 years old. This is likely due to the protective effect of maternal antibodies in infants and the accumulation of immunity in older children. In contrast, in the Western world, most cases are seen in children under 5 years old. The rate of adult cases of HFMD is quite low worldwide but can occur, particularly in the context of an outbreak or in immunocompromised individuals.

HFMD is not usually a notifiable disease, which means that comprehensive surveillance data are limited. However, outbreaks can have significant public health implications, especially when they overwhelm healthcare systems or cause severe diseases and economic impact due to higher healthcare costs and parental work absences.

Efforts to control HFMD include promoting good personal hygiene, disinfecting surfaces in shared environments like schools and daycare centers, and isolating symptomatic individuals to reduce the spread of infection. Vaccines have been developed and are used in some parts of the world against specific strains like EV71, but there is still no universally available vaccine to protect against all causes of HFMD.

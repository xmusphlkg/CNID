**Epidemiology of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness primarily affecting children. The disease is typically mild with symptoms such as sores in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet. It was first reported in 1957 in New Zealand, but Coxsackie A virus (the most common cause of HFMD) had been discovered in 1948 in the town of Coxsackie, New York.

**Global Prevalence:**
HFMD is prevalent worldwide, with variations in the predominant causative virus. The incidence of HFMD varies seasonally and is known to cause outbreaks, especially in Asia. Large epidemics have occurred in countries such as China, Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia. It's more frequent in regions with hot climates and tends to peak in the warmer months. However, actual global prevalence rates are hard to determine due to inconsistent reporting and the mild nature of the disease that often doesn't require medical attention.

**Transmission Routes:**
The primary mode of transmission of HFMD is:

1. **Direct Contact:** The virus is present in the blisters and saliva of infected individuals and can be spread through close personal contact.
2. **Respiratory Droplets:** Coughing and sneezing can disseminate the virus.
3. **Fecal-Oral Route:** The virus is present in the stool of infected individuals, making the fecal-oral route a common mode of transmission, particularly in areas with poor sanitation.
4. **Contaminated Objects and Surfaces:** Sharing toys, utensils, or touching contaminated surfaces can spread the virus.

**Affected Populations:**
HFMD primarily affects children under the age of 5, but it can also occur in older children and adults. Adults—including pregnant women—can be affected, though typically with milder symptoms or asymptomatically, which can contribute to transmission.

**Key Statistics:**
Quantifying exact cases is difficult due to under-reporting and variations in surveillance. However, large outbreaks have been documented, with the number of reported cases reaching into the millions during significant outbreaks in Asia. For instance, China reported upwards of 1 million cases annually in some years during the past decade.

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Age:** Being a child under 5 years old is the primary risk factor.
2. **Childcare Centers:** Attendance at daycares or preschools increases the risk due to close contacts and shared items among children.
3. **Immune Status:** Individuals with compromised immune systems might be at higher risk.
4. **Hygiene Practices:** Poor hand hygiene and cleanliness can elevate the risk of infection.
5. **Season:** Warmer months tend to have a higher incidence.

**Impact on Regions and Populations:**
HFMD is of particular concern in Asia, where epidemics have led to public health challenges. These areas see more frequent and severe outbreaks with tens of thousands of hospitalizations during epidemics, largely due to strains like Enterovirus 71 (EV71), which can cause more severe complications, including viral meningitis and encephalitis. 

Despite its global presence, developed countries usually report sporadic cases or small clusters rather than large outbreaks. In these cases, the disease is generally self-limiting. In contrast, developing regions may struggle with control due to limited healthcare access and infrastructure.

**Variations in Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:**
While HFMD affects both boys and girls, some reports indicate a slight predominance in males. The demographics impacted by an outbreak can also reflect the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the region, with crowded living conditions and poor sanitation playing a role in transmission dynamics.

The prevalence rates vary considerably from year to year and among different regions. The most affected groups remain children, particularly in densely populated urban areas where contact rates are higher. 

In terms of prevention and control, public health measures include promoting good hand hygiene, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and isolating affected individuals during the acute phase of the illness to reduce transmission. No vaccine is widely available for HFMD, but constant epidemiological surveillance and public health awareness are key strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease.

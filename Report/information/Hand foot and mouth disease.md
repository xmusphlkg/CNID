## Introduction

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a highly contagious viral infection primarily affecting children under five years old. It's typically caused by Coxsackievirus A16. The disease is characterized by sores in the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. It spreads through direct contact with unwashed hands or surfaces contaminated with feces. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, feeling unwell, irritability, loss of appetite, and painful sores. The disease is usually mild, with most patients recovering within a week without medical treatment.

2. Despite an overall decline in HFMD cases since 2010, a surge is noticeable in June 2023, the highest in the past eight years.<br/>
3. Remarkably, a considerable drop in death rates is observed over the years, with no fatalities reported from May 2023.<br/>
4. The disease prevalence in September remains moderate. Comparatively, September 2023 saw lower cases than recent years, which could indicate improved control measures.<br/>
## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hand foot and mouth disease cases in mainland China show a seasonal trend, with cases peaking from April to July each year from 2010 to 2023. The highest reported cases are in 2014 with 528,777 cases in May. Overall, there is a significant reduction observed in the number of cases after 2019. In the year 2020, we see a drastic decline in the number of cases, possibly due to intensive hygiene practices and social distance regulations induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths is relatively low compared to the number of cases, which indicates that the disease may not be highly lethal. Deaths tend to peak slightly later than cases, usually around April to June. Deaths are highest in 2010, reaching 186 in May. The number of deaths has shown a steady decrease over the years, reaching zero multiple times from 2017 onwards. This could be attributed to improved case management, community engagement, and awareness activities.

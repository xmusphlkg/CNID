Hepatitis B, caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), is a viral infection that specifically targets the liver. It poses a significant public health concern on a global scale, contributing significantly to disease burden and mortality rates. To provide a comprehensive understanding of hepatitis B's epidemiology, this paper offers insights into its global prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, historical context, major risk factors, and regional impacts.

1. Global Prevalence:
Hepatitis B represents a considerable global health challenge, particularly in regions with high prevalence rates such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Globally, an estimated 257 million individuals suffer from chronic HBV infection. Prevalence rates vary significantly among countries, ranging from less than 1% in areas with low endemicity to over 8% in high-endemic regions.

2. Transmission Routes:
Hepatitis B can be transmitted through various routes, including:

   a. Mother-to-child transmission during childbirth.
   b. Perinatal transmission from an infected mother to her baby.
   c. Unprotected sexual contact with an infected individual.
   d. Sharing contaminated needles or other drug paraphernalia.
   e. Blood transfusions or organ transplants from infected donors.
   f. Occupational exposure to infected blood or body fluids.
   g. Close contact with an infected person, such as household contact.

3. Affected Populations:
Hepatitis B can affect individuals of all ages and populations, but certain groups face a higher risk, including:

   a. Infants born to infected mothers (due to perinatal transmission).
   b. People with multiple sexual partners or engaging in unprotected sex with an infected individual.
   c. Individuals who inject drugs or share needles.
   d. Healthcare workers or individuals with occupational exposure to blood or body fluids.
   e. People living in regions with high endemicity, such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.
   f. Migrants from high-endemic regions.
   g. Men who have sex with men.
   h. People with compromised immune systems, such as HIV-positive individuals.

4. Key Statistics:
   a. Approximately 887,000 people die annually due to hepatitis B-related complications.
   b. Hepatitis B is responsible for over 50% of the world's liver cancer cases.
   c. An estimated 27 million people are aware of their infection, while the majority remain undiagnosed.
   d. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among children worldwide has reached 84%, although coverage varies by region.
   e. The infection can lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.

5. Historical Context and Discovery:
The discovery of the hepatitis B virus dates back to the 1960s when Dr. Baruch Blumberg identified an antigen associated with hepatitis in the blood of an Australian Aboriginal plasma donor. This antigen, referred to as the Australia antigen or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), was found to be closely linked to hepatitis B infection. Dr. Blumberg's research paved the way for the development of the first hepatitis B vaccine, which was introduced in the 1980s.

6. Major Risk Factors:
   a. Engaging in unprotected sexual contact with an infected person.
   b. Using injection drugs or sharing needles.
   c. Having a mother with hepatitis B or being born to an infected mother.
   d. Receiving blood or organ transfusions from infected donors.
   e. Occupational exposure, particularly among healthcare workers.
   f. Being a man who has sex with men.
   g. Living in or traveling to regions with high endemicity.

7. Regional Impacts:
Hepatitis B prevalence rates and affected demographics vary across different regions. Examples include:

   a. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence rates, affecting approximately 6.1% of the population.
   b. Asian countries like China, Mongolia, and Vietnam also experience significant prevalence rates.
   c. Prevalence rates in North America and Western Europe, generally low, vary depending on specific populations.
   d. Oceania has some of the highest rates globally, particularly among Indigenous populations.
   e. Eastern European and Middle Eastern countries have intermediate to high prevalence rates.

In conclusion, hepatitis B is a widely prevalent viral infection, with its impact varying by region. It affects diverse populations, with transmission occurring primarily through perinatal, sexual, and bloodborne routes. The discovery of the hepatitis B virus led to the development of an effective vaccine, but considerable challenges persist in terms of improving vaccination coverage and reducing the global impact of this disease.

## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. It's transmitted through blood and various body fluids. Key sources include mother-to-child at birth, unsafe injections, and unprotected sexual contact. Many individuals show no symptoms, while others experience jaundice, fatigue, and nausea. Chronic Hepatitis B can lead to severe health conditions like cirrhosis or liver cancer. There is a safe and effective vaccine available to prevent this disease. However, the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B remains a significant global health challenge.


## Highlights

1. There's an increasing trend in Hepatitis B cases in China since early 2020 up until September 2023, with a notable spread in August 2023 (138,875 cases, a record high)<br/>
2. Despite a rising trend in cases, the death rate appears to be stable and relatively low, indicating effective medical care<br/>
3. The significant variation in the number of cases on a monthly basis suggests seasonal influences or changes in reporting, requiring further investigation.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The table presented covers Hepatitis B data from 2010 to 2023. There is a generally fluctuating trend in the number of cases reported per month for each year. However, a significant drop in numbers was observed in February 2020 which could be linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, from 2022 the number of cases seems to be increasing with an apparent peak in August 2023 with 138,875 cases.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths varies from month to month, typically remaining well below 100 per month. There is an observable slight increase in the death count over the years, nonetheless, the numbers remain fairly low. An unexpected peak in death counts can be seen in January 2020, but the cause is not indicated in the given data. The lowest death count is seen in February 2023 at 18.

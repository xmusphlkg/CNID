Hepatitis B is a viral infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) that primarily affects the liver and can lead to both acute and chronic disease. It is a major global health concern due to its potential to cause liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). Here is a comprehensive overview of its epidemiology:

**Global Prevalence:**
As of my knowledge cutoff in April 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 296 million people were living with chronic Hepatitis B infection worldwide, with about 1.5 million new infections occurring annually. The prevalence of HBV varies widely across different geographic regions. It is highly endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, where between 5% to 10% of the adult population is chronically infected. In these regions, the majority of infections occur from mother-to-child transmission at birth or in early childhood.

**Transmission Routes:**
Hepatitis B is transmitted through contact with infectious body fluids, such as blood, semen, and vaginal secretions. Key routes of transmission include:
- Perinatal transmission (from mother to child at birth)
- Sexual transmission, particularly in unvaccinated persons
- Exposure to infected blood, often through needlestick injuries, sharing of needles or syringes among people who inject drugs, and unsafe medical practices involving contaminated equipment.
- Household contact with an infected person, particularly through open cuts or sores.

It is not spread through food or water, sharing eating utensils, breastfeeding, hugging, kissing, holding hands, coughing, or sneezing.

**Affected Populations:**
While anyone can get Hepatitis B, some populations are at increased risk:
- Infants born to infected mothers
- Healthcare and public safety workers due to their potential exposure to infected blood
- Men who have sex with men
- People who inject drugs
- People with multiple sexual partners
- Residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled persons
- Travelers to regions with high infection rates of HBV
- People with chronic liver disease and HIV are at increased risk for severe disease and complications.

**Key Statistics:**
Hepatitis B is responsible for about 820,000 deaths per year, primarily from complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is the most serious type of viral hepatitis and one of the most common infectious diseases in the world. The Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the most commonly used marker for the presence of active infection.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
The disease now known as Hepatitis B was first described by Hippocrates, but it wasn't until 1965 that the Australian scientist Dr. Baruch Blumberg discovered the Australia antigen (later known as HBsAg), which is associated with the hepatitis B virus. This led to the development of diagnostic tests and an effective vaccine, which was introduced in 1982.

**Major Risk Factors Associated with Transmission:**
- Birth to an infected mother
- Unprotected sexual contact with an infected partner
- Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment
- Exposure to infected blood, especially from needlesticks in healthcare settings
- Unsterile medical or dental equipment
- Tattooing and body piercing with non-sterile instruments

**Regional Impact and Variations in Prevalence Rates:**
The prevalence of hepatitis B is highest in the Western Pacific Region and Africa, where intermediate to high rates of chronic infection are common. Intermediate prevalences are observed in the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia regions, whereas lower prevalence rates are generally seen in the Americas and European regions.

**Affected Demographics:**
- In high endemic areas (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia), most HBV infections occur during childhood, with many children becoming chronically infected.
- In low endemic areas (e.g., the U.S., Western Europe), the disease primarily affects adolescents and adults, and transmission is often through sexual contact or intravenous drug use.

**Control and Prevention:**
Global strategies aimed at controlling and preventing HBV infection include vaccination, which is the single most effective measure. The WHO recommends that all infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine; the first dose should be given within 24 hours of birth, followed by at least two additional doses. Other preventive measures include the screening of blood donations, the use of sterile medical and dental equipment, safe sex practices, and harm reduction services for people who inject drugs. 

Chronic hepatitis B management involves regular monitoring and, in some cases, antiviral therapy to prevent or delay progression of liver disease. With a comprehensive approach, the burden of HBV can be significantly reduced.

This overview provides a snapshot of the key elements of the epidemiology of Hepatitis B. It is essential to monitor the evolving landscape of HBV, as initiatives to improve vaccine coverage and global public health strategies can significantly alter the epidemiology of this important infectious disease.

Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is a major global health problem that can cause chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer.

**Global Prevalence:**

Hepatitis B is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world, with significant variations in prevalence across different geographical regions. It is estimated that globally, in 2021, about 296 million people are living with chronic Hepatitis B infection, defined as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. The highest prevalence of HBV infection is in the Western Pacific and African regions, where 6.2% and 6.1% of the adult population, respectively, is infected.

**Transmission Routes:**

Hepatitis B is transmitted through contact with infectious body fluids such as blood, semen, and vaginal secretions, with modes of transmission including:

1. Perinatal transmission (from mother to child at birth)
2. Early childhood infections (through close interpersonal contact with infected household contacts)
3. Unsafe injection practices
4. Unprotected sexual contact
5. Blood transfusions and organ transplants using infected blood or organs

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics:**

All age groups can be affected by HBV, but the impact is greatest on those infected at a young age due to the higher risk of developing chronic HBV infections. Key statistics include:

- Worldwide, in 2021, HBV resulted in approximately 820,000 deaths, primarily from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer).
- Infants are at the highest risk of developing chronic infections; approximately 90% of infants infected during their first year of life, and 25-50% of children infected between one to five years of age, will develop chronic infections.
- About 20-30% of adults who are chronically infected during childhood will develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**

Hepatitis B has been known by various names in history and was a recognized disease for centuries. However, it was not until 1965 that Baruch Blumberg and his team identified the virus, for which he later received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1976. The discovery of the HBsAg in the blood serum of an Australian aborigine led to greater understanding and development of diagnostic tests and a vaccine.

**Major Risk Factors Associated with Transmission:**

Risk factors for HBV transmission include:

- Mother-to-child transmission during childbirth
- Exposure to infected blood, through needle sticks or sharps injuries in healthcare settings
- Shared needles during drug use
- Unprotected sex with an infected partner
- Tattooing and body piercing with non-sterile equipment
- Sharing razors or toothbrushes with an infected person

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**

- **Asia-Pacific Region:** Especially East Asia and the Pacific Islands have high rates of HBV prevalence. Chronic HBV is a leading cause of liver cancer in these areas.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa:** Chronic HBV infection rates are also high, with a significant burden of maternal-child transmission and liver cancer.
- **Western Countries:** Including North America and Western Europe, the prevalence is lower, largely due to vaccination programs and improved health and safety standards in healthcare settings and among the general population.

The introduction of the HBV vaccine, which is the first anti-cancer vaccine, has significantly reduced the prevalence rates in many regions, especially where childhood vaccination uptake is high.

**Affected Demographics:**

- Infants born to HBV-infected mothers
- Young children living in endemic areas
- Unvaccinated travelers to regions with high endemicity
- People who inject drugs
- Healthcare and public safety workers
- Individuals with multiple sexual partners or those with an HBV-infected partner
- People undergoing hemodialysis
- Recipients of blood or organs from infected donors

**Prevention and Control:**

Prevention of HBV infection relies on several key strategies:
- Hepatitis B vaccination for all infants, preferably within 24 hours of birth, followed by the completion of the vaccine series.
- Prevention of mother-to-child transmission by screening all pregnant women and providing appropriate prophylaxis to infants born to HBV-positive mothers.
- Safe blood supply, through the screening of blood donations for HBV.
- Improved infection control practices in healthcare settings.
- Education and harm reduction strategies for high-risk populations, including safer sex practices and needle exchange programs.

Control of Hepatitis B largely depends on the widespread implementation of vaccination programs and the continuous monitoring of HBV infection rates globally. Despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines since the early 1980s, a large number of people around the world remain vulnerable to infection, particularly in areas with poor access to vaccination and healthcare services. Addressing these challenges remains a major public health priority.

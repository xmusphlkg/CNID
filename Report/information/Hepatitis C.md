Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation, sometimes leading to serious liver damage. It is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here I present a comprehensive overview of various aspects of Hepatitis C within an epidemiological context.

**Global Prevalence:**

As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 58 million people globally have chronic Hepatitis C infections, with around 1.5 million new infections occurring each year. These figures, however, are likely to be underestimates due to incomplete data from many parts of the world and are subject to change as new information becomes available.

**Transmission Routes:**

The primary routes of HCV transmission are through exposure to small quantities of blood. This can occur through:

- Injecting drug use – sharing needles, syringes, or other equipment.
- Healthcare exposures – through inadequately sterilized medical equipment, unsafe injections, and transfusions (more common in countries with less stringent medical safety standards).
- Sexual contact – although less common, it can be transmitted through sexual intercourse, especially among individuals with multiple partners or who engage in rough sexual practices.
- Mother-to-child – a mother with HCV can transmit the virus to her child during birth.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**

Hepatitis C was identified in the 1980s, originally termed "non-A non-B hepatitis" because the causative agent was not yet known. The virus itself was discovered in 1989, leading to the development of serologic tests that could identify HCV.

**Risk Factors:**

Major risk factors for HCV transmission include:

- History of injecting drug use.
- Receipt of contaminated blood products or invasive procedures in healthcare settings with inadequate infection control.
- Receipt of a tattoo or piercing with non-sterile instruments.
- Shared personal items that may have come into contact with blood, like razors or toothbrushes.
- Being born to a mother with HCV.
- Occupational exposure to blood through needlestick injuries in healthcare workers.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**

Prevalence rates and affected demographics vary considerably:

- **High Prevalence Regions:** Some of the highest prevalence rates are found in parts of Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East. Prevalence is often highest in regions with poor medical infrastructure and among populations with high rates of injection drug use.
- **Variable Prevalence:** Countries with better-developed healthcare systems may have lower overall prevalence rates but can have subpopulations with high rates of HCV due to factors like historic blood transfusion practices before the virus was well understood, or concentrated epidemics among injecting drug users.

**Prevalence among Demographics:**

- In many countries, Hepatitis C is more common among people aged 30 to 49 years, reflecting the peak periods of transmission associated with drug use from the 1970s through the 2000s.
- Men tend to have a slightly higher prevalence of HCV compared to women, potentially due to higher rates of risk behaviors such as injecting drug use.
- People who inject drugs represent a major at-risk population globally, with high HCV infection rates due to sharing needles and other drug paraphernalia.

The advent of highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has significantly improved the prognosis for individuals with HCV, allowing for cure rates exceeding 95%. However, access to such therapies varies greatly by region and socioeconomic status, affecting the overall impact of HCV on populations.

Elimination efforts by various international organizations, including the WHO, are aimed at reducing new chronic infections and HCV-related mortality through improved screening, prevention strategies, and access to treatment. For instance, the WHO has set a goal of eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030. This will require significant efforts to improve surveillance, raise awareness, promote harm reduction among at-risk populations, and enhance access to testing and treatment services across the globe.

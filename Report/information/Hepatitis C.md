Hepatitis C, caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver. It is a significant global health concern, with an estimated 71 million individuals worldwide living with chronic hepatitis C infection.

Discovery and Historical Context:
Hepatitis C was first identified in the 1970s; however, it was not until 1989 that scientists isolated HCV and sequenced its genome, leading to the development of accurate diagnostic tests. This discovery revolutionized the understanding of viral hepatitis as it revealed that the majority of non-A, non-B hepatitis cases were caused by this previously unknown virus.

Global Prevalence:
Hepatitis C has a global distribution, with varying prevalence rates across different countries and regions. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 1% of the global population is living with chronic HCV infection. The highest prevalence rates are reported in certain regions of Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Central and East Asia.

Transmission Routes:
HCV is primarily transmitted through blood-to-blood contact. The most common modes of transmission include:

1. Injecting Drug Use: Sharing contaminated needles and other drug paraphernalia is the most significant risk factor for HCV transmission globally.

2. Unsafe Medical Procedures: Historically, inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of syringes, and unsafe blood transfusions/organ transplants contributed to HCV transmission. However, improved medical practices have significantly reduced this risk.

3. Unsafe Injection Practices: In some settings, unsafe injection practices, such as needle-stick injuries, syringe reuse, and inadequate infection control measures, can lead to HCV transmission.

4. Vertical Transmission: Infants born to mothers with HCV can acquire the infection during childbirth, although the risk is relatively low compared to other modes of transmission.

5. Sexual Transmission: While sexual transmission is less common, it can occur, particularly in high-risk groups like individuals with multiple sexual partners, men who have sex with men, and those with co-existing sexually transmitted infections.

6. Occupational Exposure: Healthcare workers may be at risk of HCV infection through accidental needlesticks or exposure to infected blood.

Affected Populations:
Hepatitis C affects individuals of all ages and populations. However, certain groups are at a higher risk, including:

1. People who Inject Drugs: This group carries the highest burden of HCV infection globally.

2. Individuals who received blood transfusions or organ transplants before the implementation of effective screening and testing measures for HCV.

3. Healthcare Workers: While the risk is relatively low, healthcare workers exposed to infected blood may be at risk.

4. Individuals with high-risk sexual behaviors or multiple sexual partners.

5. Children born to HCV-infected mothers.

Key Statistics and Impact:
- The majority (around 70-80%) of acute HCV infections become chronic, leading to long-term liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and, in severe cases, liver failure.
- HCV infection is responsible for approximately 399,000 deaths each year, mainly due to complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
- Treatment options for hepatitis C have significantly improved in recent years, with direct-acting antiviral therapy achieving cure rates exceeding 95%.
- However, access to diagnosis and treatment remains a challenge in many low- and middle-income countries, contributing to ongoing transmission and disease burden.

Variation in Prevalence Rates and Demographics:
The prevalence of hepatitis C varies significantly between countries and regions. Factors contributing to variations in prevalence include:

1. Injection Drug Use: Countries with high rates of injection drug use tend to have higher prevalence rates.

2. Blood Safety Measures: Countries that have implemented effective blood safety measures, such as screening donated blood, have seen a decline in HCV-related cases.

3. Healthcare Infrastructure: Regions with weaker healthcare systems and limited access to testing, prevention, and treatment services have higher prevalence rates.

4. Historical Practices: Some regions have experienced spikes in HCV transmission due to specific historical events, such as mass parenteral treatment campaigns or inadequate infection control during medical procedures.

5. Risk Behaviors: High-risk behaviors like injection drug use, unsafe sexual practices, and tattoo/piercing practices can contribute to variations in prevalence among different populations within a country.

In conclusion, hepatitis C is a global health burden with varying prevalence rates across regions and populations. It is primarily transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, with injection drug use being the most common mode of transmission globally. Improvements in screening, prevention, and treatment are essential to reduce the impact of hepatitis C on affected populations and achieve the WHO's goal of eliminating HCV as a public health threat by 2030.
## Introduction

Hepatitis C is a viral infection affecting the liver, caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is a bloodborne virus, commonly transmitted through invasive procedures like drug injection. Most people do not exhibit symptoms until liver damage appears, potentially leading to serious complications like cirrhosis or liver cancer. Acute infection can transition into a long-term chronic phase which may persist for a lifetime. There is no effective vaccine for Hepatitis C, but antiviral medication can cure about 95% of people with the virus, reducing the risk of lethal complications.

## Highlights

1. Notable rising death trend in 2023, especially from April, peaking in August and moderately declining in September. Increased morbidity rates demand improved medical attention.<br/>
2. Case count shows near cyclical patterns annually, perhaps due to climate influence, with high case numbers often seen in March and July-August.<br/>
3. Despite small fluctuations in the number of cases over the years, sustained high count emphasizes the dire need for advancing public health measures.<br/> 
4. September 2023 report indicates continued high cases and deaths, showing an urgent situation with Hepatitis C in Mainland China.<br/> 
5. Intense improvement in diagnosis and treatment facilities plus prevention methods are critical to curb the escalating mortality in 2023.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
In the period from 2010 to 2023, Hepatitis C cases showed irregular trends with occasional spikes and decreases, but overall they have been increasing over the years. The highest reported monthly cases were around 24,977 in March 2016. Interestingly, February 2020 saw a sharp drop in cases (9068), possibly due to the COVID-19 outbreak impacting medical reporting or other resource allocation. However, the general trend remains within the 13,000-24,000 monthly case range.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to Hepatitis C were relatively low till July 2022, ranging between 1 and 21 per month. However, a concerning uptick in fatalities was observed from August 2022 onward, reaching a maximum of 186 in June 2023. This sudden surge suggests the emergence of a more severe strain of the virus or changes in healthcare infrastructure, requiring immediate public health attention to prevent further loss. This might be reflecting a public health emergency associated with diagnosis, treatment, or healthcare access.

Hepatitis D, also referred to as delta hepatitis, is a viral infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). Unlike other forms of hepatitis, HDV can only occur as a co-infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or as a superinfection in individuals already infected with HBV. HDV is considered the most severe form of viral hepatitis due to its tendency to lead to more severe liver disease and an increased risk of liver failure.

Historical Background: The discovery of Hepatitis D took place in 1977, when Dr. Mario Rizzetto, an Italian scientist, identified a novel antigen in patients with chronic liver disease. It was later determined that this antigen was associated with a small RNA virus, which was then named the hepatitis D virus.

Modes of Transmission: Hepatitis D is primarily transmitted through contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids. The main routes of transmission include:

1. Co-infection: HDV can be acquired simultaneously with HBV through exposure to infected blood or through sexual contact with an infected individual.

2. Superinfection: Individuals already infected with chronic HBV are at risk of acquiring HDV if exposed to someone with HDV. Superinfection often leads to a more severe form of hepatitis compared to HBV alone.

3. Vertical transmission: HDV can also be transmitted from an infected mother to her newborn during childbirth or through breastfeeding.

Affected Populations: Hepatitis D is found worldwide, but its prevalence varies among regions and populations. The highest prevalence is observed in areas where chronic HBV infection is widespread, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the Amazon basin, Central Asia, Mongolia, and the Pacific Islands. In these areas, HDV infection rates can range from 1% to 60% among individuals with chronic HBV infection.

Key Statistics and Risk Factors:

1. Global Prevalence: It is estimated that approximately 15-20 million people, amounting to 5% to 20% of chronic HBV carriers worldwide, are co-infected with HDV.

2. Increased Severity: HDV infection is associated with a higher risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) compared to HBV infection alone.

3. Injection Drug Use: Sharing contaminated needles and syringes poses a significant risk factor for HDV transmission, particularly among people who inject drugs.

4. Blood Transfusions: Prior to the implementation of routine screening for HDV, blood transfusions were a common route of transmission. However, with improved screening measures, the risk of transfusion-related HDV infections has significantly decreased.

5. Unsafe medical practices: In regions with inadequate infection control and sterilization practices, as well as poor screening of blood and blood products, healthcare-associated transmission of HDV can occur.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:

1. Sub-Saharan Africa: HDV is highly endemic in this region due to the high prevalence of chronic HBV infection and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. HDV-related liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

2. Amazon Basin: In the Amazon region, HDV prevalence rates can reach up to 60% among individuals with chronic HBV infection. This high prevalence is due to widespread transmission through contaminated needles used in traditional practices such as tattooing and body piercing.

3. Eastern Europe and Central Asia: These regions have intermediate to high HDV prevalence, mainly driven by injection drug use and unsafe medical practices.

4. Pacific Islands: Many Pacific Island nations have a high prevalence of HDV due to traditional cultural practices involving blood contact and shared tattooing tools.

In conclusion, Hepatitis D is a significant global public health concern, primarily affecting populations with high rates of chronic HBV infection. Efforts to control HDV mainly focus on preventing HBV infection through vaccination and implementing comprehensive public health strategies to reduce transmission risks associated with blood contact, injection drug use, and unsafe medical practices.

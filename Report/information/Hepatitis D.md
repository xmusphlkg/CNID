Hepatitis D, also known as hepatitis delta, is a liver infection caused by the Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) which is an incomplete virus that requires the presence of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) to replicate. HDV infection can occur as either a co-infection with HBV or a superinfection in individuals who are chronic HBV carriers.

**Historical Context and Discovery:** 
Hepatitis D was discovered in 1977 by Italian physician Mario Rizzetto and his team when they observed a novel antigen-antibody system in the liver biopsies of patients with chronic hepatitis B. The new antigen, detected in the nuclei of hepatocytes, was named the delta antigen, and the associated virus was later identified as HDV.

**Global Prevalence:**
The global prevalence of HDV infection has significantly decreased with the implementation of the HBV vaccination. However, HDV remains a concern in various regions, particularly in parts of Central Africa, the Amazon Basin, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.

**Transmission Routes:**
HDV transmission routes are similar to those of HBV, including:
- Parenteral transmission through exposure to infected blood or blood products.
- Use of unsanitary needles (e.g., needle sharing among injection drug users).
- Unprotected sexual contact with infected individuals.
- Vertical transmission from mother to child during childbirth, though less common than with HBV.

**Affected Populations:**
Individuals at high risk of HDV infection typically coincide with those at risk for HBV. This includes:
- People who inject drugs and share needles.
- Those receiving unscreened blood transfusions or undergoing unsafe medical procedures.
- Sexual partners of individuals with HBV and HDV.
- Infants born to HBV-infected mothers.

**Key Statistics:**
While worldwide data fluctuates, estimates suggest that approximately 15-20 million people are infected with HDV globally, with variations in reporting based on diagnostic capabilities and surveillance systems. The prevalence of HDV among HBV carriers is estimated to be around 5%. Chronic HDV infection leads to more severe liver disease compared to infection with HBV alone and accelerates the progression towards liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

**Major Risk Factors:**
The main risk factors for Hepatitis D transmission are essentially those for HBV and include:
- Lack of vaccination against HBV.
- High-risk sexual behaviors.
- Injection drug use with shared paraphernalia.
- Exposure to infected blood through transfusions or occupational hazards in healthcare settings.
- Travel or residence in endemic areas without prior immunization.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
The impact of HDV varies by region:
- In Europe, the prevalence of HDV is relatively low except in Mediterranean countries and parts of Eastern Europe where it is higher.
- In Africa, especially in Central Africa, HDV infection rates are high, and the impact is significant due to co-factors like HIV co-infection and weaker health infrastructure.
- The Amazon Basin in South America has high rates of HDV infection, particularly among indigenous populations.
- The Middle East, particularly countries like Iran and Pakistan, also report significant HDV presence.

**Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:**
HDV prevalence is closely tied to that of HBV; therefore, the demographics affected by HBV are at risk for HDV. Certain groups like injection drug users or individuals with multiple sexual partners are disproportionately affected. Migrants and refugees from endemic areas may carry a higher prevalence rate into non-endemic areas, impacting local transmission patterns.

Mortality and morbidity associated with HDV are considerable, as it is associated with more complicated clinical outcomes, including fulminant hepatitis in acute cases and accelerated progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer in chronic cases.

**Prevention and Control Measures:**
Vaccination against HBV is the primary preventive measure against HDV because it cannot establish an infection in the absence of HBV. Other measures include safe injection practices, the screening of blood donors, safer sex practices, and harm reduction programs for injecting drug users.

Continued surveillance, research on therapeutic interventions, and targeted vaccination programs in high-prevalence areas are key strategies for managing and reducing the burden of HDV globally.

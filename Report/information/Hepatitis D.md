Hepatitis D, also known as delta hepatitis, is a viral infection that only occurs in individuals who are already infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a defective RNA virus that relies on HBV for replication. The co-infection of HBV and HDV leads to a more severe form of liver disease.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Hepatitis D was initially identified in 1977 by Dr. Mario Rizzetto and his colleagues in Italy. They discovered a new antigen in the blood of patients with chronic hepatitis B, which they named the delta antigen. Later, it was determined that this antigen was linked to a new virus, HDV.

Global Prevalence:
Hepatitis D is a significant public health concern in many regions around the world, although its prevalence varies greatly. The prevalence of HDV is highest in areas where HBV infection is widespread, including Sub-Saharan Africa, the Amazon Basin, Mongolia, and parts of Eastern Europe and Asia. In these regions, 70-90% of individuals with HBV also have HDV co-infection. Conversely, in Western countries and places with effective HBV vaccination programs, the prevalence of HDV is relatively low.

Transmission Routes:
Hepatitis D is mostly transmitted through contact with infected blood. The primary mode of transmission is through percutaneous exposure to contaminated blood or blood products, such as sharing needles or syringes among drug users, receiving tainted blood transfusions or organ transplants, and unsafe medical procedures. While less common, transmission can also occur through sexual contact and from mother to child. Moreover, close household contact with an infected individual can result in HDV transmission.

Affected Populations:
Hepatitis D primarily affects individuals already infected with HBV. Therefore, at-risk populations for HDV infection include those with chronic HBV infection, injection drug users, individuals undergoing hemodialysis, and those who have received contaminated blood or blood products. HDV infection is more common among men, likely due to higher rates of risky behaviors.

Key Statistics:
- Approximately 15-20 million people worldwide are estimated to be co-infected with HBV and HDV.
- The prevalence of HDV varies significantly among regions, ranging from less than 1% in certain European countries to over 70% in specific Sub-Saharan African countries.
- HDV infection is associated with more severe liver disease and a higher risk of liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma compared to HBV infection alone.
- The annual global mortality rate due to HDV is estimated to be 20,000 to 30,000 deaths.

Major Risk Factors:
The primary risk factor for HDV transmission is having chronic HBV infection. Other risk factors include injection drug use, sharing needles or syringes, receiving contaminated blood or blood products, and engaging in unsafe medical procedures. Additionally, unprotected sexual contact with an individual infected with both HBV and HDV can lead to HDV transmission.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of HDV varies across different regions and populations. In areas with high rates of HBV and HDV co-infection, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Amazon Basin, HDV infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. In these regions, HDV significantly contributes to the burden of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Conversely, in Western countries with successful HBV vaccination programs, the prevalence of HDV is lower, and the disease has a limited impact.

In conclusion, Hepatitis D is a viral infection that exclusively occurs in individuals with HBV. Its global prevalence varies, with high rates in regions where HBV infection is endemic. HDV transmission occurs through percutaneous exposure, sexual contact, and maternal-fetal transmission. HDV infection leads to more severe liver disease than HBV infection alone and carries a higher risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding the epidemiology and impact of HDV is crucial for implementing effective prevention strategies and improving global healthcare.

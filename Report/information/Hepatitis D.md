**Overview of Hepatitis D:**

Hepatitis D, also known as delta hepatitis, is a disease caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), an incomplete virus that requires the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) to replicate. HDV is considered a satellite virus because it can only infect people who are also infected with HBV.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**

Hepatitis D was first discovered in 1977 by Dr. Mario Rizzetto and colleagues during their investigation of hepatitis B virus in Italy. They identified a new antigen-antibody system in the serum of hepatitis B patients, which they termed the delta antigen. Subsequently, this was linked to what is now known as hepatitis D virus.

**Global Prevalence:**

The global prevalence of HDV has decreased due to the effective vaccination against HBV. Despite these efforts, HDV remains a concern in several regions, particularly in parts of Asia, Africa, South America, and the Eastern Mediterranean. It's estimated that 15-20 million people are infected with HDV worldwide, but this could be an underestimate due to underdiagnosis and underreporting.

**Transmission Routes:**

Hepatitis D is transmitted primarily through:

1. Parenteral exposure to infected blood or blood products.
2. Sharing of contaminated needles by intravenous drug users.
3. Mother-to-child transmission during childbirth (less common).
4. Unprotected sexual contact, particularly in individuals with high-risk sexual behavior.

HDV relies on HBV for its transmission; therefore, it follows similar pathways of spread as HBV.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics:**

Affected populations include:

1. Individuals coinfected with HBV, especially those who are not vaccinated against hepatitis B.
2. Intravenous drug users due to the shared use of contaminated needles.
3. Recipients of unsafe blood transfusions or those exposed to non-sterile medical procedures.
4. People with high-risk sexual behaviors.
5. Communities with high levels of HBV infection have a higher propensity for HDV coinfection.

**Major Risk Factors:**

The major risk factors associated with HDV transmission are similar to those for HBV and include:

- Unprotected sex with an infected person.
- Intravenous drug use.
- Occupational exposure in healthcare settings (needlesticks accidents).
- Being born to a mother infected with HBV/HDV.
- Living with someone who has a chronic HBV/HDV infection.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**

The impact of hepatitis D varies around the world:

- **Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia:** High endemicity areas with significant proportions of the population coinfected with HBV/HDV. The disease burden is compounded by limited access to medical care and vaccinations in some regions.
- **Europe and North America:** Lower prevalence due to wide-scale hepatitis B vaccination programs and better access to healthcare. However, certain groups, such as immigrants from high prevalence areas and IV drug users, are still at risk.
- **South America and the Middle East:** Intermediate to high prevalence rates have been seen, with specific countries reporting significant HDV infection rates among HBV carriers.

**Affected Demographics:**

HDV affects demographics similarly to HBV. However, because HDV is a much rare virus and requires HBV to replicate, the demographics that have higher rates of HBV infection will naturally be more affected by HDV. Some regions and populations, such as Indigenous communities in the Amazon Basin and parts of Central Asia, are more heavily impacted by HDV due to various factors, including cultural practices and healthcare infrastructure.

**Conclusion:**

Preventing HDV infection is largely dependent on controlling HBV through vaccination and safe practices to prevent the transmission of blood-borne pathogens. The epidemiology of hepatitis D demonstrates the importance of public health initiatives targeting high-risk populations, the need for improved surveillance and reporting, and access to diagnostic and treatment facilities to manage and reduce the incidence and prevalence of this serious coinfection worldwide.

Hepatitis E is a viral infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and primarily affects the liver. It is a disease that is widely present globally, particularly in countries with limited resources and inadequate sanitation facilities. Hepatitis E is mainly transmitted through the fecal-oral route, primarily through contaminated water and food. It can also be transmitted through person-to-person contact, blood transfusion, and vertical transmission from mother to fetus.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Hepatitis E was first recognized in 1955 during a large outbreak in Delhi, India. However, the virus was not identified until 1990 when it was isolated from the feces of infected individuals. The discovery of the virus led to the development of diagnostic tests, and subsequently, cases of hepatitis E were detected worldwide.

Global Prevalence:
Hepatitis E is a significant global health issue, with an estimated 20 million cases and approximately 70,000 deaths occurring each year. The highest burden of the disease is observed in regions with limited access to clean water and proper sanitation, such as Asia, Africa, and Central America. Outbreaks are more common in developing countries, particularly after natural disasters or in conflict-affected areas.

Transmission Routes:
The primary route of transmission for hepatitis E is the consumption of contaminated water or food. Contaminated shellfish, pork, and game meats have been identified as sources of infection. The virus can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected individuals, including sexual contact and blood transfusion.

Affected Populations:
Hepatitis E can affect individuals of all ages. However, pregnant women, especially those in their third trimester, are particularly vulnerable to severe forms of the disease, with a higher risk of mortality. Other vulnerable populations include individuals with pre-existing liver disease, such as those infected with hepatitis B or C, and individuals with compromised immune systems.

Key Statistics:
1. The global prevalence of hepatitis E is estimated to be around 2% of the population, but this varies significantly by region.
2. The case fatality rate ranges from 0.5% to 3% and can reach up to 20% in pregnant women during the third trimester.
3. Mortality rates are highest in low-income countries, where access to healthcare is limited.
4. Around 20% of acute hepatitis cases worldwide are caused by hepatitis E.
5. Outbreaks occur frequently in areas with inadequate sanitation, especially during periods of natural disasters or conflict.

Major Risk Factors:
1. Lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities.
2. Consuming raw or undercooked meat, particularly pork and game meats.
3. Consuming shellfish from contaminated waters.
4. Traveling to regions with high hepatitis E prevalence.
5. Being pregnant, especially in the third trimester, as the risk of severe disease and mortality is increased.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of hepatitis E varies across regions and populations. In countries with limited resources and poor sanitation infrastructure, hepatitis E is a significant public health concern. These regions experience frequent outbreaks, resulting in high rates of sickness and death. Pregnant women are at particular risk in these settings. In developed countries, hepatitis E is less common but can still occur through travel to regions where the disease is prevalent, consumption of contaminated foods, and cases resulting from blood transfusions.

In conclusion, hepatitis E is a globally prevalent disease primarily transmitted through contaminated water and food. The disease burden is highest in regions with inadequate sanitation, and pregnant women and those with pre-existing liver disease are at an increased risk of severe complications. Efforts to improve sanitation, increase access to clean water, and promote safe food practices are crucial in reducing the transmission and impact of hepatitis E.

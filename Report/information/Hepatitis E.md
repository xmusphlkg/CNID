Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. There are at least four distinct genotypes of the virus that can infect humans. The epidemiology of Hepatitis E varies greatly between different regions and populations, with significant implications for public health.

**Global Prevalence and Historical Context:**

The discovery of Hepatitis E dates back to the 1950s when outbreaks of unexplained hepatitis occurred in India. It wasn't until the late 1970s and early 1980s that more evidence accumulated pointing to the existence of a new form of non-A, non-B hepatitis. The virus was officially identified in 1983 when Soviet military researchers provided the first direct evidence of a virus causing the disease by successfully transmitting infection to primates with stool extracts from an outbreak. The virus was cloned and sequenced in 1990.

Hepatitis E has a global distribution but is most prevalent in developing countries with poor sanitation and hygiene, where it usually causes waterborne epidemics. It is considered endemic in many parts of Central and Southeast Asia, Northern and Western Africa, and Mexico. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are about 20 million HEV infections worldwide annually, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases and 44,000 deaths.

**Transmission Routes:**

1. **Fecal-Oral Route:** HEV is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, typically through contaminated water. Large outbreaks have been associated with contaminated water supplies in countries with poor sanitation infrastructure.
2. **Zoonotic Route:** Certain genotypes of HEV (particularly genotypes 3 and 4) are zoonotic and can be transmitted from animals to humans. Pigs, wild boar, and deer are recognized reservoirs. Consumption of undercooked or raw meat and liver from these animals can lead to infection.
3. **Blood Transfusion:** In rare cases, the virus can be transmitted through blood transfusion.
4. **Vertical Transmission:** Pregnant women can transmit the virus to their unborn children.

**Affected Populations:**

- **General Population:** While everyone can potentially contract HEV, young adults between the ages of 15 and 40 are the most frequently affected demographic in endemic regions.
- **Pregnant Women:** HEV infection is particularly severe in pregnant women, especially during the third trimester, with reported mortality rates up to 20-30%. The reason for this increased severity is not fully understood.
- **Immunocompromised Individuals:** People with weakened immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients, patients with HIV/AIDS, and those receiving chemotherapy, can develop chronic HEV infection, which can lead to progressive liver damage.

**Major Risk Factors:**

1. Poor Sanitation: Limited or no access to clean water and poor sewage disposal systems increase the risk of HEV transmission.
2. Travel: Travel to endemic regions can pose a higher risk of acquiring HEV for individuals from non-endemic areas.
3. Dietary Habits: Consumption of raw or undercooked meat and liver from infected animals, particularly pork or wild game, can increase the risk of zoonotic transmission.
4. Occupation: Individuals working with pigs, wild boars, or in sewage management may have a higher risk of exposure to HEV.

**Regional Impact and Variations in Prevalence:**

- **Asia & Africa:** These regions account for the vast majority of HEV infections due to poor sanitary conditions, frequent flooding, and the common occurrence of waterborne outbreaks. HEV genotype 1 predominates in Asia, and genotype 2 is observed frequently in Africa and Mexico.
- **Developed Countries:** In these regions, HEV cases are often sporadic or result from zoonotic transmission; genotypes 3 and 4 are more prevalent here. The incidence of HEV is likely underestimated due to less routine testing for the virus.

In conclusion, Hepatitis E remains a significant global public health concern, especially in areas with inadequate water supply and sanitation. Efforts to improve water quality, food safety, widespread health education, and improved sanitation practices are critical for controlling HEV transmission. In endemic areas, improving the surveillance and reporting systems is essential to understand and track the burden of disease more accurately. Although a vaccine for HEV (HEV 239, sold under the brand name Hecolin) has been developed and is available in China, it is not widely accessible in other parts of the world, making prevention strategies even more critical.

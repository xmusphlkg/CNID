Human infection with the H7N9 virus, a subtype of avian influenza, was first identified in China in 2013. The emergence of H7N9 raised concerns due to its potential to cause severe illness and high fatality rate. This comprehensive overview aims to provide information on the global prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, historical context, discovery, risk factors, and the impact of H7N9 virus on different regions and populations.

Epidemiology of H7N9 Virus Infection:
1. Global Prevalence: Since its discovery in 2013, human cases of H7N9 infection have primarily been reported in China. However, a few imported cases have been detected outside of China, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, Malaysia, and the United States.

2. Transmission Routes: The primary mode of H7N9 virus transmission is through direct contact with infected poultry, particularly in live poultry markets. Human-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus is limited and has mainly been observed among close household contacts of infected individuals.

3. Affected Populations: H7N9 infection primarily affects individuals who have direct or indirect contact with poultry, such as workers in live poultry markets, poultry farmers, and those with exposure to contaminated environments. Most reported cases have occurred in older adults (average age 58 years) with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, or immunosuppression. While children are comparatively less affected, cases have been reported in all age groups.

4. Key Statistics: As of February 2021, a total of 1,568 laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 infection have been reported globally, with a fatality rate of approximately 39%. The majority of cases have occurred in mainland China, with only a few cases reported in other countries.

Historical Context and Discovery:
The first cases of human infection with the H7N9 virus were reported in China in March 2013. These cases were initially identified in Shanghai and later spread to several other provinces in eastern China. The rapid detection and identification of the virus were made possible by the strengthening of China's surveillance systems following the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in 2003.

Risk Factors Associated with H7N9 Transmission:
1. Direct or Indirect Contact with Poultry: The primary risk factor for H7N9 transmission is close contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments in live poultry markets or poultry farms. Individuals working in the poultry industry have a higher risk of infection.

2. Low Awareness and Protective Measures: Individuals with limited awareness of preventive measures, such as proper hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, and avoidance of live poultry markets, are at a higher risk of H7N9 infection.

3. Underlying Medical Conditions: Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, especially diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and immunosuppression, are more susceptible to severe illness and complications from H7N9 infection.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of the H7N9 virus varies across regions and populations. Mainland China has observed the highest number of cases and fatalities. Prevalence rates have been higher in provinces with intensive poultry production and live poultry markets. The elderly population and individuals with underlying medical conditions have experienced higher mortality rates compared to healthier individuals.

Outside of China, imported cases have been reported, but human-to-human transmission has been limited, resulting in a lesser impact on other regions. Timely detection, surveillance, and public health interventions have contributed to preventing widespread outbreaks in these areas.

In summary, the H7N9 virus primarily affects individuals with close contact with infected poultry, and human-to-human transmission is limited. The virus has had a significant impact on China, particularly with high fatality rates among older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. Public health efforts and increased awareness of preventive measures remain crucial in controlling the spread of H7N9 infection and mitigating its impact.
## Introduction

Human infection with H7N9 virus refers to a type of avian influenza infection that humans can contract from exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. The virus emerged in China in 2013, causing severe respiratory illnesses in humans, frequently progressing to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Human-to-human transmission is rare, but when it occurs, it raises public health concerns due to historical pandemic outcomes. No vaccines for general public use are currently available, making prevention efforts critical.


## Highlights

1. There has been a significant decline in the number of H7N9 virus cases since 2017 with zero cases reported since 2020.<br/>2. The fatality rate varied over the years, with the highest being in 2017, but has also dropped to zero since 2020.<br/>3. As of September 2023, no new cases or deaths have been reported, indicating successful control over the disease.<br/>4. Despite no current cases, maintaining surveillance is crucial considering the past volatility and potential resurgence.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The data shows that cases of Human infection with H7N9 virus in mainland China peaked in the early part of 2014, with a significant surge in late 2016 and early 2017. Following 2017, the data indicates a rapid decline in the number of cases, becoming virtually non-existent by 2019 onwards. The spike in January 2014, January and February 2017 suggest H7N9 has potential seasonality, as these are winter months and many viruses, including influenza strains, exhibit winter seasonality.


### Deaths Analysis

Deaths from the H7N9 virus follow a similar pattern with highest number of deaths in early 2014 and again in early 2017, concurrent with the peak cases. The case fatality rate (CFR), calculated as deaths/cases, however, seems to have been relatively high, meaning a significant proportion of those infected with the virus unfortunately died from it. Similar to cases, the number deaths dramatically reduced post-2018 and no deaths were reported after April 2019.

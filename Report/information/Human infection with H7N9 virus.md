Human infection with the H7N9 virus is a type of avian influenza that was first reported in China in March 2013. Avian influenza viruses are categorized by two types of proteins on their surface: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The H7N9 strain is of particular concern because it has shown the capability to cause severe respiratory illness and, in some cases, death in humans. Since its first detection, the epidemiology of H7N9 has been closely monitored by global and national health agencies.

**Global Prevalence:**
Since 2013, cases of H7N9 have been predominantly reported in China, with the majority occurring in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions. Despite concentrated efforts to control the virus, sporadic human cases and occasional outbreaks have occurred since the virus was first identified. The number of reported cases has varied over time, with noticeable peaks during the winter and spring months, coinciding with the flu season when the contact between humans and infected poultry is higher.

**Transmission Routes:**
The primary route of transmission of H7N9 from birds to humans is through direct exposure to infected live poultry or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets. Human-to-human transmission is considered rare; however, there have been some family clusters reported, suggesting limited person-to-person transmission when there is close and prolonged contact. There is no evidence that the H7N9 virus can be transmitted to humans through properly cooked poultry products.

**Affected Populations:**
The majority of reported cases have been among people who have had contact with live poultry or visited live poultry markets. This has included individuals working in the poultry industry, such as farmers and market workers, as well as customers of these markets. Middle-aged and older adults have been more frequently affected, but cases have been reported in a range of age groups.

**Key Statistics:**
The fatality rate for H7N9 cases has varied, but severe illness leading to hospitalization has been common among reported cases. Among those infected, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported case fatality rates of around 30-40%, making it one of the more deadly strains of avian influenza for humans.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
The first documented cases of human infection with H7N9 virus were reported in China in early 2013. The virus was initially detected when patients developed severe respiratory infections of unknown cause. Subsequent investigations traced the infection back to poultry markets.

**Major Risk Factors:**
- Contact with live poultry, especially in markets where they might be kept in unhygienic conditions.
- Exposure to environments contaminated with the virus, including surfaces and air in live bird markets.
- Unsuitable handling and slaughtering practices that may lead to exposure to infected birds.
- Lack of proper personal protective equipment for those in contact with live poultry.
- Undercooked poultry or contaminated food products.

**Regional and Population Impact:**
The impact of H7N9 has been specifically significant in China due to the cultural and economic importance of live poultry markets, the proximity of birds and humans, and the large poultry population. Some neighboring countries have raised concerns and increased surveillance, but few cases have been reported outside of China. 

Variations in prevalence are largely attributed to differing practices in the poultry industry, the effectiveness of live poultry market closures, and public health interventions such as culling of infected birds, market sanitation, and public awareness campaigns.

The prevalence and impact on demographics in the affected regions can be correlated with occupational exposure to poultry and culturally ingrained practices of purchasing and handling live birds. For example, older adults may be overrepresented because they are more often involved in the buying of fresh poultry from live bird markets.

Overall, the epidemiology of human infection with H7N9 virus requires continuous surveillance and aggressive public health measures to prevent the virus from becoming more widespread. This includes close monitoring of poultry markets, ongoing research into the virology of H7N9, vaccine development, and public health education campaigns to minimize high-risk behaviors associated with transmission.

Human infection with H7N9 avian influenza virus first emerged in China in March 2013. The H7N9 virus is one of several subtypes of avian influenza viruses that have been detected in birds in the past. However, until 2013, this particular subtype had not been known to infect humans.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
The H7N9 virus is an influenza A virus of avian origin. It was first reported in humans in the Shanghai and Anhui provinces of China. The initial cases were severe and resulted in pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because these initial cases resulted in human fatalities, the emergence of H7N9 prompted concerns globally, given the potential for pandemics posed by avian influenza viruses.

**Global Prevalence:**
Since its discovery, H7N9 has largely been contained within China. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinaâ€™s National Health Commission, sporadic human cases continued to be reported since 2013, with seasonal peaks in winter and spring to align with increased poultry infections. 

There have been several waves of H7N9 outbreaks in China, the most significant wave occurring in the winter-spring season of 2016-2017. This resulted in more cases than all the earlier waves combined. Outside China, a very limited number of cases were reported - typically in individuals who had traveled to China or surrounding areas.

**Transmission Routes:**
The primary route of transmission is direct contact with infected birds or environments contaminated with the virus. Bird-to-human transmission is the most common, while limited human-to-human transmission has been suspected in some cases but is not sustained or ongoing, which reduces the risk of it becoming a pandemic without significant mutations.

**Affected Populations:**
People in direct contact with live poultry, such as poultry farmers, market workers, and those who prepare poultry for consumption, constitute a higher risk population. The virus does not equally affect all age groups, with a majority of cases being recorded among middle-aged and older individuals, which might be due to younger individuals having less exposure or perhaps better immune responses.

**Key Statistics:**
As an emerging virus, the statistics for H7N9 are not as comprehensive as those for more well-known diseases. However, during the first waves of outbreaks, the case-fatality rates were relatively high, and many cases required hospitalization and intensive care.

**Major Risk Factors Associated with Transmission:**
The primary risk factors include:
- Exposure to live poultry or visiting wet markets where poultry is sold.
- Working in the poultry industry.
- Possibly, a genetic susceptibility to infection.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
The impact has been largely localized to China where almost all of the cases have been reported. Different provinces in China have reported varying prevalence rates, which are influenced by the density of poultry farming and cultural practices including live poultry markets.

**Variations in Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:**
Urban and suburban areas with high poultry density and live bird markets experienced higher prevalence rates, although sporadic cases could appear elsewhere due to movement of people or animals. Demographics affected tend to skew towards older males, which may reflect occupational exposure patterns.

Since the initial outbreaks, the Chinese government has put in place various measures to control the spread of H7N9, including the temporary closure of live bird markets, stricter regulations on poultry farming, culling of infected birds, and the development of seasonal vaccines aimed at high-risk populations.

Public health agencies worldwide, including the WHO, continue to monitor the H7N9 situation closely because the potential for an avian influenza virus to mutate and become more transmissible among humans could have significant public health implications.

It is important to keep in mind that this information may evolve, as the epidemiology of infectious diseases can change rapidly. This overview is based on the situation as understood until my last training data in April 2023. Future developments in the epidemiology of H7N9 could result from changes in the virus, host, environment, or interplay among these factors.

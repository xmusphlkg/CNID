Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can cause severe neurological infection in humans. It is caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which is a member of the Flaviviridae family, related to dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses.

### Historical Context and Discovery
Japanese encephalitis was first recognized as a distinct clinical entity in Japan in the 1870s. The virus itself was isolated during an outbreak in Japan in 1935. Since its discovery, the disease has been found across a wide geographical area in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific.

### Global Prevalence
JE is prevalent in many Asian countries. Over 3 billion people live in regions where the disease is endemic. The virus is primarily found in rural and agricultural areas, where there are suitable water bodies for mosquito breeding and where pigs and wading birds are presentâ€”the main amplifying hosts. The incidence of JE varies from country to country and even within different regions of a country, depending on the presence of competent mosquito vectors and suitable vertebrate hosts.

### Transmission Routes
JEV is transmitted through the bite of infected Culex species mosquitoes, particularly Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The virus maintains an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, primarily pigs and water birds. Humans can be infected, but they are considered dead-end hosts since they do not develop high enough viremia to pass the virus back to feeding mosquitoes.

### Affected Populations
The main risk group for JE includes people living in rural areas where the disease is common, especially where irrigation practices favor mosquito breeding. Children are particularly at risk because adults in endemic regions often have acquired immunity through past infection or vaccination.

### Key Statistics and Risk Factors
An estimated 68,000 clinical cases occur annually, but many infections are asymptomatic or result in mild symptoms. Fatality rates among those with encephalitis can be as high as 30%, and of those who survive, 20-30% suffer from persistent neurological sequelae. The major risk factors for JEV infection include:

- Living or traveling in endemic regions, especially rural areas.
- Engaging in outdoor activities in endemic areas, especially during the evening and night when Culex mosquitoes are most active.
- Lack of vaccination in endemic areas.

### Impact on Different Regions and Populations
The impact of JE is more significant in countries where the virus is endemic and where vaccination programs are not adequately implemented.

- **East and Southeast Asia:** These regions have the highest reported cases of JE, with varying incidence rates due to differing healthcare surveillance and immunization strategies.
- **South Asia:** JE is a significant public health concern, particularly in India, Nepal, and Myanmar. Outbreaks can cause a large number of cases due to dense populations and optimal mosquito-breeding conditions.
- **The Western Pacific:** JE remains a threat in areas where agricultural practices support mosquito breeding, despite advances in public health.
  
The prevalence rate and affected demographics can vary based on factors such as local vaccination policies, public health initiatives, the presence of natural immunity within the population, mosquito control efforts, and changes in land use that may increase mosquito habitats.

### Control and Prevention
Efforts to control JE include the use of vaccines, which have been available since the late 1960s and have been effective in reducing the number of cases. Vector control measures, such as mosquito nets and insecticides, are also important, especially for travelers and those living in endemic areas without access to the vaccine. Surveillance to monitor JE cases can help in early detection of outbreaks and guiding public health interventions.

It is important to note that while JE primarily affects countries in the Asia-Pacific region, globalization and climate change have the potential to affect the incidence and distribution of many vector-borne diseases, including JE. Thus, ongoing research and public health vigilance remain crucial to preventing the spread and mitigating the impact of Japanese encephalitis.

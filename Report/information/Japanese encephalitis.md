Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne viral infection that affects the central nervous system. It is caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
JE was first recognized in Japan in the 1870s. The causative agent, JEV, was subsequently isolated during the 1930s. Since its discovery, JE has been documented across much of Asia and parts of the Western Pacific, becoming a significant public health problem in these regions.

**Global Prevalence:**
JE is most common in rural agricultural areas in Asia, where rice cultivation and pig farming provide ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 3 billion people live in regions where JE is endemic. The disease occurs from the easternmost islands of the Pacific Ocean to the Himalayas, and as far south as Australia.

**Transmission Routes:**
JEV is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Culex species mosquitoes, particularly Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The mosquitoes become infected by feeding on birds (especially wading birds) and pigs that have high levels of JEV in their blood. Pigs are especially important amplifying hosts that facilitate the transmission to humans, who are dead-end hosts, meaning that JEV does not reach high enough levels in human blood to infect biting mosquitoes.

**Affected Populations:**
While anyone in a JE-endemic area can be infected, certain populations are at higher risk. This includes people living in rural agricultural areas, children under 15, and individuals who spend substantial time outdoors in JE-endemic locations.

**Key Statistics:**
- JE causes an estimated 68,000 clinical cases each year, though the incidence of infection is likely much higher due to subclinical infections.
- Case fatality rates among those with encephalitis can be as high as 30%.
- Survivors can suffer from long-term neurological sequelae. Approximately 30-50% of survivors have cognitive, behavioral, or neurological problems.
- Vaccination programs have significantly decreased JE incidence in countries like Japan and South Korea.

**Major Risk Factors:**
The following factors increase the risk of JE:
- Proximity to rice fields and pig farming areas.
- Seasonal patterns, with most human cases occurring during the summer and fall when mosquito populations peak.
- Lack of immunity, particularly in areas where JE is not endemic or among travelers from non-endemic regions.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
- Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific are the most affected. High prevalence rates are seen in countries like Vietnam, India, Nepal, and China.
- Urbanization and changes in agricultural practices have influenced transmission patterns, sometimes extending the reach of JEV or introducing it into new areas.
- Children are particularly vulnerable because adults in endemic areas often acquire natural immunity due to subclinical infection early in life.
- Vaccination campaigns have reduced incidence in countries like Japan, where the disease was once very prevalent.

**Prevention and Control:**
Prevention focuses on vaccination, especially in high-risk areas. Safe and effective vaccines are available, and the WHO recommends integration of JE vaccination into national immunization schedules in areas where JE is recognized as a public health issue.

Control of mosquito populations and personal protective measures (e.g., use of repellent, bed nets, and wearing long sleeves and trousers) are also important, particularly for travelers and those at occupational risk.

Japanese encephalitis remains a disease of concern due to its potential severity and the large population at risk. Ongoing research, surveillance, and public health efforts are essential to control and prevent JE. Climate change, ecological disruption, and global travel could modify transmission patterns, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and adaptation of control strategies.

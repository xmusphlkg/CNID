Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a viral disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus. It is primarily found in East and Southeast Asia, with sporadic cases reported in other regions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis.

Historically, the first major outbreak of Japanese encephalitis was reported in Japan in the 1870s. In the 1920s, the virus was isolated for the first time, and its connection to neurological symptoms was established. Since then, JE has been recognized as a significant public health concern in many Asian countries.

Japanese encephalitis is endemic in 24 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including India, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, and others. However, the disease can also spread to non-endemic regions, such as Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the Pacific Islands. Travelers from non-endemic regions can acquire the infection while visiting endemic areas.

JEV is mainly transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes, primarily from the Culex genus. Pigs and wading birds act as hosts for the virus, while mosquitoes serve as vectors for transmission between these animals and humans. JE is primarily a rural agricultural disease, common in areas with wetland rice cultivation and pig farming.

Children, especially those under 15 years of age, are the most affected population group by JE. However, adults who have not been previously exposed to the virus are also at risk. The disease is more prevalent in rural areas with abundant vector mosquitoes and amplifying hosts. Individuals involved in farming, rice field work, and those living near pig farms or wetlands are at a higher risk of JE.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 68,000 cases of Japanese encephalitis occur annually, resulting in 13,600 to 20,400 deaths worldwide. However, these numbers are likely underestimated due to limited healthcare access and surveillance systems in affected regions. The case fatality rate varies widely, ranging from 5% to 30%, with higher rates in older populations.

Several risk factors increase the transmission of Japanese encephalitis:

1. Mosquito Exposure: Living or working in areas with high mosquito populations, especially during peak transmission seasons, increases the risk of JE.

2. Rural Agricultural Activities: People involved in rice farming and pig rearing are at an elevated risk due to close proximity to mosquito vectors and amplifying hosts.

3. Lack of Vaccination: Individuals who have not been previously vaccinated against JE are more susceptible to infection.

4. Travel to Endemic Areas: Travelers from non-endemic regions who visit areas with ongoing JE transmission are at risk if they are not immunized or take preventive measures to avoid mosquito bites.

The impact of Japanese encephalitis varies across different regions and populations. In endemic areas, particularly in rural and agricultural communities, the disease is a significant public health concern. Countries with high burden, such as India and China, report a substantial number of cases each year. Japanese encephalitis can cause long-term neurological disabilities, cognitive impairments, and economic burdens on affected individuals and their families.

Efforts have been made in recent years to control Japanese encephalitis through vaccination campaigns. Vaccination programs targeting high-risk populations, especially children in endemic areas, have shown promising results in reducing the disease burden.

In conclusion, Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease primarily found in Asia. It is transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes and primarily affects children and individuals living in rural agricultural areas. The disease has a significant impact on affected regions and populations, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccination and control measures play a vital role in preventing the transmission and reducing the burden of Japanese encephalitis.

Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is a parasitic disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. The disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. It primarily affects the visceral organs, such as the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.

**Global Prevalence and Distribution:**
Kala-azar has a widespread global distribution but is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, occurring in more than 80 countries. The highest burden is in East Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Brazil. Populations in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Brazil account for more than 90% of global VL cases.

**Transmission Routes:**
The two main transmission routes for Kala-azar are anthroponotic and zoonotic:
1. *Anthroponotic*: Human beings are the only significant reservoir, and transmission occurs directly from person to person via the sandfly vector. This is the predominant mode in the Indian subcontinent.
2. *Zoonotic*: Domestic animals, particularly dogs, and wild animals serve as reservoirs for the disease, with transmission to humans occurring through sandfly bites. This form is common in East Africa, parts of Europe, and Brazil.

**Affected Populations:**
Certain socioeconomic and environmental conditions heighten the risk of VL. The populations most affected tend to live in rural areas, in poverty, and with limited access to healthcare and preventive measures. The disease also shows a seasonal pattern coinciding with the activity of sandflies.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
The term "kala-azar," which means "black fever" in Hindi, was first used in the early 20th century in India. The disease itself has been known since ancient times, but the causative organism, Leishmania donovani, was discovered by William Boog Leishman and Charles Donovan around the beginning of the 20th century.

**Key Statistics:**
Globally, there are an estimated 50,000 to 90,000 new cases of VL each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, due to underreporting, the actual number of cases may be higher. The case-fatality rate can be high without proper treatment, with rates above 10% reported in some areas.

**Major Risk Factors:**
The risk factors associated with the transmission of Kala-azar include:
- Poor housing conditions and living close to sandfly breeding sites.
- Malnutrition, which can weaken the immune system.
- Climate change, increasing the range of sandflies.
- Population displacement and the movement of non-immune people into endemic areas.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
- *Indian Subcontinent*: Here, VL is primarily anthroponotic, and efforts to control the disease have shown success, with significant reductions in cases. India has launched an elimination initiative aiming to reduce the incidence to less than 1 case per 10,000 at the sub-district level.
- *East Africa*: Particularly in Sudan and South Sudan, VL presents significant challenges due to ongoing conflicts and displacement, which hinder control efforts and access to treatment.
- *Brazil*: Zoonotic transmission means control measures must also address animal reservoirs, making eradication efforts complicated.
- *Mediterranean region and Middle East*: Both zoonotic and anthroponotic forms occur, with children often being the most affected demographic.

**Variations in Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:**
Prevalence rates vary widely between regions due to differences in vector ecology, host reservoirs, and socioeconomic conditions. In some regions, VL might mostly affect young children, while in others, all age groups are at risk.

In summary, Kala-azar is a disease that primarily affects the most vulnerable populations in poor, rural settings. While some regions have made strides in controlling the disease, global efforts must continue to focus on vector control, improving living conditions, strengthening health systems, and developing more effective treatments and vaccines to reduce the prevalence and impact of VL.

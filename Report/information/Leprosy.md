Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes. A comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of leprosy is crucial for the development of effective prevention, control, and treatment strategies. This overview will cover the global prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, historical context, major risk factors, and impact on different regions and populations.

Global Prevalence:
Leprosy is predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 175,176 reported cases of leprosy globally at the end of 2019, with a registered prevalence rate of 0.2 cases per 10,000 population. While the overall global prevalence has significantly decreased in recent decades, there are still countries with high transmission rates, such as India, Brazil, and Indonesia.

Transmission Routes:
Leprosy primarily spreads through respiratory droplets from infected individuals, although the exact transmission route remains unclear. It is not highly contagious and requires prolonged contact with an untreated person with the disease for transmission to occur. Close and frequent contact with individuals affected by the bacteria is the major route of transmission.

Affected Populations:
Leprosy can affect individuals of any age, but it is most commonly observed in adults, with men being more susceptible than women. People living in poverty, with inadequate access to healthcare, and in overcrowded conditions are at higher risk due to factors such as malnutrition, poor hygiene, and weakened immune systems. Additionally, genetic factors can contribute to susceptibility to the disease.

Key Statistics:
Most countries have successfully eliminated leprosy as a public health problem at the national level. However, a few countries still experience high prevalence rates. In 2019, India, Brazil, and Indonesia had the highest number of new cases. Brazil had the highest new case detection rate, followed by India and Indonesia. Multibacillary (more severe) leprosy cases account for approximately 60% of reported cases globally.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Leprosy has afflicted humanity for centuries. Historical records and skeletal remains indicate that the disease has been present since ancient times. In the Middle Ages, leprosy was highly stigmatized and feared, which led to the establishment of leprosariums, isolated communities where individuals affected by leprosy were forced to live. The exact discovery of the disease's causative agent, M. leprae, and the development of effective treatment occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Major Risk Factors:
Several risk factors contribute to leprosy transmission, including close and prolonged contact with an untreated person with leprosy, living in crowded and unhygienic environments, poor immune function, malnutrition, poverty, and genetic susceptibility. Addressing these risk factors is crucial for effectively reducing the transmission and impact of leprosy.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of leprosy varies significantly across regions and populations. India carries the highest burden of leprosy, accounting for more than half of the new cases globally. Brazil and several other countries in Africa and Asia also face significant challenges in relation to leprosy prevalence. The disease often disproportionately affects marginalized populations, such as individuals living in poverty, migrants, and remote rural communities. Stigma and discrimination associated with leprosy remain major challenges, resulting in delayed diagnosis, social isolation, and limited access to healthcare.

In conclusion, leprosy remains a significant public health concern in certain regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Efforts to control and eliminate leprosy continue, including early detection, proper treatment, and addressing social stigma. Understanding the epidemiology of leprosy is crucial for developing and implementing effective strategies to reduce transmission, provide appropriate care, and improve the lives of those affected by the disease.
## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. This disease primarily affects the skin and peripheral nerves, but can also involve the eyes and the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. Often characterized by lesions and nerve damage, leprosy transmission is believed to occur via respiratory droplets. The disease is curable with a multi-drug therapy, preventing disabilities and transmission. Despite its decline globally, leprosy still poses significant challenges in some regions.

## Highlights

1. The overall trend of Leprosy cases in mainland, China is decreasing over the reported period from 2010 to 2023.<br/>
2. The mortality rate of Leprosy patients has remained exceptionally low, with sporadic instances of deaths per month throughout the years.<br/>
3. The reported cases of Leprosy in September 2023 stand at 23, demonstrating a considerable decrease when compared with the same month in previous years.<br/>
4. Notably, there's a cyclical trend with a spike usually occurring around March and the lowest figures observed towards the end of each year.
5. Even amongst this decline, regular occurrences of the disease signify its continued presence and the necessity for ongoing public health measures.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the course of 13 years (2010-2023), China's monthly leprosy case count appears to steadily decrease. The data demonstrates a consistent trend with higher frequencies in the early years (approximately 100 cases/month in 2010) and considerably lower rates in recent years (about 30 cases/month in 2023). Peaking periods shift from spring in 2010 (March) to summer months (June) in subsequent years. By 2023, the peak has seemingly moved to early spring (February-March). There is sparse data for 2013's January and February, which limits some interpretability.

### Deaths Analysis
The death data shows a very low mortality rate related to leprosy from 2010 to 2023. Most months in this period reported zero deaths, indicating that leprosy's lethality is consistently low, which is most likely due to advanced treatments available. However, occasional mortalities occur in each year. These seem random and do not follow a clear pattern, hinting at possibly other contributing factors like patient's overall health conditions. In recent years, mortalities are especially rare, with only three reported deaths since 2016.

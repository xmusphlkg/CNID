Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites of the Plasmodium species, which is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is a prevalent infectious disease that particularly affects tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Malaria has a significant impact on global health, posing a risk to millions of individuals and leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually.

Historically, malaria has been a major public health concern. The disease was first identified in ancient China around 2700 BC, and descriptions of malaria-like symptoms can be found in ancient Egyptian writings and Indian Ayurvedic texts. In the 17th century, European colonizers encountered malaria in tropical regions, including areas now known as the Americas and Africa. The term "malaria" originated from the Italian words "mala aria," which means "bad air," as it was believed that the disease was caused by foul-smelling air in swampy areas. It was not until the late 19th century that Sir Ronald Ross, an English physician, discovered that the true cause of malaria was the mosquito as the vector transmitting the disease.

Malaria is present in approximately 90 countries, with sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of Central and South America experiencing the highest burden of the disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were an estimated 228 million cases of malaria worldwide and over 400,000 deaths in 2018. However, it is important to acknowledge that these figures may underestimate the actual burden due to under-reporting and limited access to healthcare in many affected regions.

The primary mode of malaria transmission is through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. There are five species of Plasmodium that can cause malaria in humans, with P. falciparum being the most lethal and responsible for the majority of malaria-related deaths. In addition to mosquito bites, malaria can also be transmitted through blood transfusion, sharing of contaminated needles, or from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth.

Malaria affects individuals of all age groups, but young children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable. In areas with high malaria transmission, children under the age of five are at the greatest risk of severe illness and death. Pregnant women are also more susceptible to malaria, and the infection can result in adverse outcomes such as maternal anemia, low birth weight, and an increased risk of infant mortality.

Key statistics pertaining to malaria include the following:
- In 2018, approximately 94% of malaria cases and deaths occurred in the WHO African Region.
- Two-thirds of malaria deaths worldwide were children under five years old.
- In regions with high transmission, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.

Multiple factors contribute to the transmission and spread of malaria, including mosquito breeding sites like stagnant water bodies such as puddles, swamps, and irrigated fields. Inadequate use of insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and larval control measures also contribute to increased mosquito populations and higher transmission rates. Additionally, climate and geography play a role, as malaria transmission is influenced by factors such as rainfall patterns, temperature, and altitude. Socioeconomic conditions, limited access to healthcare, and inadequate diagnostic and treatment facilities further contribute to the persistence of malaria in endemic regions.

Malaria disproportionately impacts certain regions and populations, with sub-Saharan Africa bearing the highest burden with about 93% of malaria cases and deaths worldwide. Within this region, children under five, pregnant women, and individuals living with HIV/AIDS are particularly vulnerable. In Asia, countries like India, Indonesia, and Myanmar have a high malaria burden. Central and South America, including the Amazon Basin region, are also affected by the disease. However, the prevalence and severity of malaria can vary across countries and even within regions due to differences in malaria control measures, local mosquito species and their ability to transmit malaria, availability of diagnostic tools and effective treatment, and access to healthcare services.

In conclusion, malaria remains a significant global public health issue, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Its high prevalence, transmission through infected mosquitoes, and impact on vulnerable populations make it a major cause of illness and death. Efforts to combat malaria include vector control measures, early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and research into new interventions such as vaccines.
## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It typically presents as a severe flu-like illness with symptoms including fever, chills, vomiting, and body ache. Globally, malaria is most prevalent in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, potentially causing severe illness or death, especially in children and pregnant women. Control and prevention strategies include mosquito control and using preventative therapies. The diagnosis relies on microscopic identification of the parasite or antigen-based tests.

## Highlights

1. There's a consistent downward trend in Malaria cases and deaths in mainland China over the years (2010-2023).<br/>
2. Notably, there're seasonal trends with cases typically peaking during the summer months (June - August).<br/>
3. However, an unusual spike was observed in August 2022, break the downward trend.<br/>
4. In September 2023, numbers of Malaria cases were 193 with 1 death, relatively low compared to the same period in previous years.<br/>
5. Starting from 2020, the cases and deaths have remained significantly lower, indicating effective Malaria control measures.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data for Malaria in China shows a declining trend from 2010 to 2022 with some fluctuations. The number of cases typically peaks in summer (June, July) and then decreases towards the end of the year. For example, in 2010, the cases peaked at 1094 in August and dipped to 459 in December. Despite some variations, there has been a drastic decrease between 2019 and 2020, from 231 cases in December 2019 to 40 cases in May 2020, and this low trend continues till 2022. However, in 2023, there is a notable resurgence exceeding 200 monthly cases from May to August, hinting towards a potential outbreak.

### Deaths Analysis
Trend analysis of Malaria related deaths from 2010 to 2023 indicates a somewhat inconsistent pattern, though deaths are generally low, often restricted to single digit numbers. However, an unexpected surge occurred in September 2012, reporting 32 deaths. The fluctuations continue with no apparent seasonal trend. Most notably, there has been a significant reduction in malaria-related fatalities from 2020. The zero-fatality trend, however, experiences occasional disruption, such as in July and October 2020, July and December 2021, and July, August, and December 2022. The year 2023 witnessed more consistent single-digit fatalities through the months. Overall, despite the dynamic malaria case numbers, the mortality rates remain relatively low.

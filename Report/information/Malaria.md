Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The disease is caused by Plasmodium parasites, among which Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax pose the greatest threat.

**Global Prevalence and Historical Context:**
Malaria has been affecting humans for over 4,000 years. Historical records suggest that symptoms similar to malaria were described in ancient Chinese and Egyptian writings. The disease played a significant role in the history and demographics of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, shaping military campaigns, colonial expansion, and even the genetics of affected populations (e.g., sickle cell trait).

The term "malaria" comes from the Italian words "mal" (bad) and "aria" (air), as it was once believed to be caused by bad air from swamps. The life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite was discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran identifying the parasite in 1880, and later, Ronald Ross showing that mosquitoes transmitted malaria to birds, and Giovanni Battista Grassi along with others establishing how it was transmitted to humans.

In the 20th century, efforts to control and eliminate malaria included the use of the pesticide DDT and antimalarial medicines such as chloroquine. Despite these efforts, malaria remains endemic in several regions globally.

**Transmission Routes:**
Malaria is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito, which occurs mainly between dusk and dawn. There are other less common transmission routes, including congenitally from mother to fetus, blood transfusions, and the sharing of needles or syringes.

**Affected Populations:**
Most malaria cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. However, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, and to a lesser extent, Central and South America, are also affected. Populations living in poverty, without adequate housing and access to health care, are at greater risk. In malarial areas, children under 5 and pregnant women are the most affected groups due to their lower immunity.

**Key Statistics:**
As of my last update in April 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported in their World Malaria Report 2022, that there were an estimated 241 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2020, and the disease caused an estimated 627,000 deaths. However, improved access to malaria control interventions had led to significant reductions in cases and deaths compared to the turn of the century.

**Risk Factors:**
Risk factors for malaria include:

- Climate and weather: Warm temperatures and consistent rainfall are ideal for mosquito breeding.
- Proximity to mosquito breeding sites: Living or working near stagnant bodies of water increases risk.
- Lack of protective measures: Inadequate use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and antimalarial drugs.
- Travel to endemic areas: Non-immune individuals traveling to high-risk areas are particularly susceptible.

**Regional and Population Impact:**
The impact of malaria varies widely:

- In sub-Saharan Africa, the high prevalence of P. falciparum results in high morbidity and mortality, especially in children under 5 years old.
- In Southeast Asia and Latin America, P. vivax is more prevalent, which often leads to relapsing infections.
- Some regions have been successful in malaria control or elimination, including parts of the Eastern Mediterranean and Central America.

**Preventive Measures and Control Strategies:**
Key strategies for malaria control include the use of ITNs, IRS with insecticides, prompt diagnostic testing and effective antimalarial treatment, preventative antimalarial medications for pregnant women and travelers, and creating and strengthening health care infrastructures. Improving socioeconomic conditions, education, and community awareness are also crucial to reducing the prevalence of malaria.

Global efforts, coordinated by the WHO, along with partnerships such as the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partnership and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, have made significant inroads into malaria control and eradication in many regions. 

There's an active research focus on developing an effective malaria vaccine, and as of my last update, the RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirixâ„¢) vaccine has been recommended by the WHO for broad use in children living in areas with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission, which marks a significant milestone in the fight against this disease.

Continued research on understanding the biology of malaria parasites and mosquito vectors, as well as monitoring and integrating responses to issues like drug and insecticide resistance, are vital to the sustained control and eventual eradication of malaria.

Measles, also known as rubeola, is a contagious viral infection primarily affecting children. It is caused by the measles virus, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family. Measles spreads through respiratory droplets and typically presents with symptoms including fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash. Despite being preventable through vaccination, measles continues to be a significant global public health concern.

Epidemiology:

Global Prevalence: Measles is found worldwide, but its prevalence varies geographically. Before widespread vaccination, measles was nearly universal in childhood. Since the introduction of the vaccine in the 1960s, significant progress has been made in reducing measles cases and deaths. However, measles remains endemic in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries with limited access to vaccination programs.

Transmission Routes: Measles primarily spreads through respiratory droplets. Infected individuals can transmit the virus to others through coughing, sneezing, or direct contact with nasal or throat secretions. The virus can survive in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours, making it highly contagious.

Affected Populations: Measles primarily affects children, particularly those who have not received the vaccine. However, individuals of any age, including adults, can contract measles if they have not been immunized or have not previously had the infection. Infants who are too young to receive the vaccine and individuals with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable.

Key Statistics: Prior to widespread vaccination, measles caused approximately 2-3 million deaths annually. However, thanks to global immunization efforts, this number has significantly decreased over the years. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated approximately 207,500 measles deaths worldwide, equivalent to approximately 567 deaths per day or 24 deaths per hour.

Historical Context and Discovery: Measles has been known for centuries. Ancient Chinese, Persian, and Arabian texts described the symptoms of measles as early as the 9th century. However, the first formal description of the disease was made by the Persian physician Rhazes in the 10th century. The virus responsible for measles was not discovered until 1954 by American physician Thomas Huckle Weller and colleagues.

Major Risk Factors:

1. Lack of Vaccination: The primary risk factor for contracting measles is the absence of vaccination. Unvaccinated individuals who come into contact with the virus are highly susceptible to infection.

2. Travel to Endemic Areas: Traveling to regions with active measles transmission increases the risk of contracting the disease. Unvaccinated individuals traveling to countries with low immunization rates or ongoing outbreaks are particularly vulnerable.

3. Lack of Healthcare Infrastructure: Limited access to healthcare services, particularly in developing countries, contributes to low immunization rates and increases the risk of measles outbreaks.

Impact on Regions and Populations:

Prevalence Rates: The prevalence of measles varies globally. Regions such as Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific have higher incidence rates compared to countries with robust vaccination programs. In contrast, regions like the Americas, Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean have achieved significant reductions in measles cases, primarily due to vaccination efforts.

Affected Demographics: Measles can affect individuals of any age and demographic; however, outbreaks often occur in populations with lower vaccine coverage. These include communities with vaccine hesitancy, marginalized populations, and areas with weak healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, overcrowded settings such as refugee camps and schools can facilitate rapid measles transmission.

In conclusion, measles is a highly contagious viral infection that remains a significant global public health concern. Although vaccination has dramatically reduced measles cases and deaths, outbreaks still occur, particularly in regions with limited access to immunization programs. Lack of vaccination, travel to endemic areas, and limited healthcare infrastructure are the primary risk factors for measles transmission. Efforts to increase vaccination coverage and strengthen healthcare systems are essential to further control and prevent the spread of measles.
## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the Rubeola virus. It can lead to serious complications, particularly in children, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death. Initial symptoms present after a 10-12 day incubation period and include fever, cough, a runny nose, and a distinct rash spreading from the face and neck to the rest of the body. Its primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. Immunization through the MMR vaccine is a highly effective preventative measure.

## Highlights

1. Cases and fatalities show substantial decline: The data reveals a remarkable reduction in both the number of Measles cases and deaths in mainland China since 2010.<br/>
2. General seasonality is observed: Higher incidence rates are noticeable every spring, particularly between March and May. However, 2023 peaks are less severe.<br/>
3. Zero mortality since 2016: Remarkably, there have been no reported deaths from Measles since 2016.<br/>
4. Stable numbers from 2020: The number of cases remained relatively consistent since 2020, with average monthly cases around 80-110.<br/>
5. September 2023: In line with the general trend, September 2023 reported 78 cases with zero deaths.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The measles data from mainland China reveals interesting temporal trends. There is an observable surge of cases between the spring and summer of each year, typically from March to May, suggesting a seasonal influence on transmission. However, since 2015 there is a noticeable decline in the number of reported cases. In 2010, we recorded the highest case count with around 13318 cases in May. The reported cases had remarkably decreased by 2023, with a high of 109 reported cases in May. Analysing this trend suggests a significant victory of public health measures against measles and possibly an increase in population immunity.

### Deaths Analysis
The rates of reported deaths remain proportionally low compared to the case counts, indicating a significant survival rate among infected individuals. Interestingly, despite reductions in case counts over time, annual total deaths don't seem to show a clear decreasing pattern until after 2016. The largest number of deaths in one month was 12 in 2010, considerably low in relation to the high case numbers. This data further underscores the importance of early detection and proper medical attention for measles. However, even with lower mortality, the persistence of measles cases indicates ongoing transmission and the need for further infection control measures.

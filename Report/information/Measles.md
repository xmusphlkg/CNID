Measles is an acute viral respiratory illness known for its highly contagious nature. It is caused by the measles virus, a paramyxovirus of the genus Morbillivirus.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
The history of measles likely dates back to the 7th century or earlier, with the first clinical description provided by the Persian physician Rhazes in the 9th century. Measles was differentiated from smallpox in the 10th century due to the presence of a rash and fever. The virus itself was isolated by John F. Enders and Thomas C. Peebles in 1954, which eventually led to the successful development of a live attenuated measles vaccine in the 1960s by Dr. John Enders and his colleagues.

**Global Prevalence:**
Historically, measles has been a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Before widespread vaccination, measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. The incidence of measles has decreased substantially with the implementation of widespread vaccination programs. However, global coverage has been uneven, leading to outbreaks and continued transmission in certain areas. As of my knowledge cutoff in April 2023, measles outbreaks continue to occur in communities with low vaccination rates.

**Transmission Routes:**
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known, primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also live for up to two hours in the airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. People can contract measles by breathing in these droplets or, upon contact with infected surfaces, by touching their faces. Measles can be transmitted from four days before to four days after the appearance of the rash.

**Affected Populations:**
Measles can affect individuals of any age but is most severe in children under the age of 5 and adults over the age of 20. Populations that are at greatest risk include those living in areas with low vaccination rates, people who travel internationally, and those who are immunocompromised.

**Key Statistics:**
- In regions where vaccination rates are high, cases of measles have notably decreased. However, in areas with lower vaccination rates, outbreaks can occur.
- The case fatality rate can be up to 5-10% in low-income countries.
- Complications of measles can include pneumonia, encephalitis, blindness, and severe diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration.

**Major Risk Factors:**
- Lack of vaccination is the primary risk factor for measles transmission.
- Travel to regions with current measles outbreaks increases the risk of exposure.
- Infants too young to be vaccinated and persons with compromised immune systems who cannot be vaccinated.

**Regional Impacts:**
Measles affects regions differently due to disparities in vaccination coverage and healthcare resources. Areas that have maintained high levels of vaccine-induced immunity report fewer cases and outbreaks. However, in regions with poor healthcare infrastructure, political instability, vaccine hesitancy, or resource limitations, measles continues to pose a significant public health challenge.

**Affected Demographics:**
Measles primarily affects unvaccinated children, but in areas where vaccination rates have declined, adults who either never contracted the disease or were never vaccinated are also at risk. In general, regions with lower socioeconomic status have higher risks of measles incidences due to the challenges associated with accessing vaccination services.

The impact of measles is not limited to health alone but also brings about economic implications, including costs related to healthcare provision, lost productivity due to illness or death, and broader societal impacts affecting education and development. Global health efforts aim to eliminate measles through vaccination strategies and public health initiatives, but challenges remain due to funding, conflict zones, logistical difficulties, and vaccine hesitancy. The goal of complete measles eradication is achievable, and efforts continue in this direction, especially through the work of organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the measles virus (MeV). It primarily affects children, but individuals of any age can be infected. Measles is found worldwide, and despite the availability of an effective vaccine, it remains a significant public health concern.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Measles has been a human disease for centuries, with historical records describing outbreaks as early as the 9th century. However, it was not until the 18th century that the distinct nature of measles was recognized, leading to the identification of the virus in the 1950s. The development of a vaccine in the 1960s greatly reduced the global burden of measles.

Global Prevalence:
Measles is found in all regions of the world. Before the introduction of the vaccine, measles was a common childhood illness that caused millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths globally each year. However, with widespread vaccination campaigns, significant progress has been made in reducing the global burden of measles. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles cases decreased by 73% between 2000 and 2018. Despite this progress, measles outbreaks still occur, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage.

Transmission Routes:
Measles is highly contagious and spreads primarily through respiratory droplets. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the virus can survive in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours. People within close proximity to an infected individual can inhale the virus or touch contaminated surfaces and subsequently infect themselves by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known, with an average of 9 out of 10 susceptible individuals who come into contact with an infected person developing the disease.

Affected Populations:
Measles affects individuals of all ages, but its impact is most severe in children under the age of five and adults over the age of 30. Infants under the age of one who have not received the measles vaccine are particularly vulnerable. Additionally, individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or malnutrition, are at higher risk of severe complications from measles.

Key Statistics:
- In 2018, there were an estimated 9.8 million measles cases globally, resulting in 140,000 deaths.
- The majority of measles-related deaths occur in low-income countries with limited healthcare access.
- In high-income countries, measles cases are often associated with pockets of unvaccinated individuals or imported cases from other regions.
- Measles outbreaks can occur in any community with low vaccination rates, including affluent areas.

Major Risk Factors:
1. Lack of Vaccination: The primary risk factor for measles transmission is low vaccination coverage. Communities with low vaccination rates, whether due to vaccine hesitancy, limited access to healthcare, or vaccine misinformation, are more prone to measles outbreaks.
2. International Travel: Measles can easily spread across borders through international travel. Unvaccinated individuals traveling to areas with ongoing measles outbreaks or bringing the virus back to their home countries can introduce the disease to susceptible populations.
3. Crowded Settings: Measles thrives in crowded environments where close contact is common, such as schools, daycare centers, and refugee camps. Outbreaks can rapidly spread in these settings.
4. Poverty and Limited Healthcare Access: Communities with limited access to healthcare and poor sanitation are at higher risk of measles outbreaks due to reduced vaccination coverage and compromised immune systems.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
Measles prevalence varies across regions due to differences in vaccination coverage and healthcare infrastructure. Low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia have higher measles burden and associated mortality rates. These regions often face challenges in delivering routine immunization services and implementing effective surveillance systems. In contrast, high-income countries with robust healthcare systems have achieved significant control of measles, but sporadic outbreaks can still occur due to unvaccinated individuals or imported cases.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of measles in various regions, including Europe and the United States. Factors contributing to this resurgence include vaccine hesitancy, misinformation campaigns, and the spread of measles in close-knit communities with low vaccination rates.

In conclusion, measles remains a global public health concern despite the availability of an effective vaccine. Low vaccination rates, international travel, crowded settings, and limited healthcare access are major risk factors for measles transmission. The impact of measles varies across regions, with low-income countries experiencing higher prevalence rates and mortality. Continued efforts to strengthen immunization programs and address the underlying factors contributing to measles transmission are crucial to achieving global measles elimination.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that remains a significant cause of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Here's a comprehensive overview of its epidemiology:

**Global Prevalence:**

As of my knowledge cutoff in April 2023, measles had seen a significant worldwide decline after the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s, but it had not been eradicated. It tends to occur in cycles, with periodic outbreaks even in countries where it was once considered controlled or eliminated. Regions with weaker healthcare systems or low vaccination coverage are especially prone to outbreaks.

**Transmission Routes:**

Measles is caused by the measles virus, a paramyxovirus of the genus Morbillivirus. It is highly contagious and is transmitted from person to person primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also be spread through direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected individuals and, less commonly, by airborne transmission.

Infected individuals are usually contagious from about four days before the rash appears to about four days afterward. Measles can be spread by an infected person before they even know they have the disease — even before they have developed any symptoms.

**Affected Populations:**

Before widespread vaccination, measles was primarily a childhood disease. The majority of those infected were children under the age of 5. Without vaccination, infants are particularly at risk of contracting measles due to their undeveloped immune systems.

Key Statistics:

- Measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children, despite the availability of a vaccine.
- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hundreds of thousands of measles cases occur worldwide every year, but underreporting is common.
- Before the introduction of the measles vaccine, major epidemics occurred approximately every 2–3 years, and measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.
- During outbreaks, case fatality rates can reach up to 5-10% in some populations.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**

Measles has been recognized since at least the Roman Empire, with descriptions by Persian physician Rhazes in the 9th century being one of the first to differentiate between measles and smallpox. The measles virus was not isolated until 1954 by Thomas C. Peebles and colleagues, who collected blood samples from infected students during an outbreak in Boston, Massachusetts.

**Major Risk Factors for Transmission:**

The major risk factors associated with measles transmission are:

- Lack of vaccination or incomplete vaccination, which is the primary risk factor.
- Travel to areas where measles is prevalent, especially for unvaccinated individuals.
- Malnutrition, particularly vitamin A deficiency, which can exacerbate the severity of the disease.
- Compromised immunity, whether due to HIV/AIDS, leukemia, or treatment which that the immune system.
- Living in crowded conditions, which can facilitate the spread of the virus.
- Any interruption in vaccination coverage, whether due to misinformation, access issues, or complacency, can lead to resurgence.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**

- **Developed Regions**: Measles was declared eliminated from the Americas in 2016; however, occasional outbreaks still occur, often due to international travel from regions where measles is more common and communities with lower vaccination rates.
  
- **Developing Regions**: Measles remains endemic in parts of Africa and Asia, with these regions accounting for the majority of cases and deaths. Health system limitations and vaccination gaps are major contributors to the high prevalence.

- **Affected Demographics**: While children under 5 years old are the most susceptible demographic, measles can affect unvaccinated people of all ages.

Global health initiatives like the Measles & Rubella Initiative (founded by partners like the American Red Cross, CDC, UNICEF, WHO, and others) have been focusing on increasing vaccination coverage to prevent measles outbreaks. However, political instability, vaccine hesitancy, and poor healthcare infrastructure pose ongoing challenges to measles eradication efforts.

The introduction of the measles vaccine has led to a dramatic decrease in cases and deaths from measles. Continued efforts in vaccination, public health infrastructure, and global surveillance are essential to reduce the global burden of measles and move towards the goal of eradication.

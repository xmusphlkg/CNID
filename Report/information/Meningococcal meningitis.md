Meningococcal meningitis is an acute bacterial infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges. It is most commonly caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. The disease is a serious public health concern due to its potential to cause widespread epidemics with high mortality and morbidity rates.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
The first documented outbreak of meningococcal disease was in Geneva in 1805. The causative organism, Neisseria meningitidis, was first isolated in 1887 by Austrian bacteriologist Anton Weichselbaum. Over the centuries, the disease has led to several pandemics and numerous epidemics across the globe.

**Global Prevalence:**
Meningococcal meningitis is found worldwide, but the highest burden of the disease is in the "meningitis belt," an area in sub-Saharan Africa that stretches from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Although epidemics in this region used to be frequent and devastating, the introduction of the MenAfriVac vaccine in 2010 has dramatically reduced the number of cases.

Outside of the meningitis belt, sporadic cases, clusters, and limited outbreaks occur globally. The incidence rate of meningococcal disease varies widely from less than 1 case per 100,000 people per year in North America and Europe to 10â€“1000 times higher during outbreaks in parts of Africa.

**Transmission Routes:**
Meningococcal meningitis is transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing and direct contact with an infected person, including kissing, sharing utensils, or other close contacts. Neisseria meningitidis is found in the nasopharynx and is commonly carried without causing illness. Only a small percentage of carriers develop meningococcal meningitis.

**Affected Populations:**
All age groups can be affected, but the highest rates of meningococcal disease occur in children under five years old, with a second peak in incidence among teenagers and young adults. People with certain medical conditions (e.g., asplenia or complement component deficiencies), those living in communal settings (e.g., dormitories, military barracks), and travellers to endemic areas are also at increased risk.

**Key Statistics:**
- Approximately 1.2 million cases of meningococcal disease are estimated to occur worldwide every year.
- The case-fatality rate of meningococcal meningitis can be as high as 10%, even with appropriate treatment.
- Among those who survive, up to 20% suffer from serious sequelae, including hearing loss, neurologic disability, or limb loss.

**Major Risk Factors:**
- Close contact with a person who is sick or carries the bacteria.
- Living in crowded conditions.
- Environmental factors such as dryness and dust storms (factors in the meningitis belt).
- Immunocompromised states or certain genetic factors.
- Lack of access to vaccination.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
- In Africa, particularly within the meningitis belt, the disease has historically had a profound social impact due to high rates of illness and death.
- In developed countries, incidence rates are lower, but outbreaks still occur, often in closed communities or among specific age groups.
- Variations in prevalence are often related to the serogroup of the bacteria; for example, serogroup A was predominant in the African meningitis belt, while B, C, Y, W, and X serogroups are more common in other parts of the world.

Vaccination against meningococcal meningitis has dramatically changed the landscape of the disease. Several meningococcal vaccines are available and target different serogroups. Vaccination strategies vary by region and are based on the predominant serogroup and local epidemiology.

The incidence and distribution of meningococcal meningitis continue to evolve, influenced by factors such as vaccination coverage, natural immunity within populations, and changes in the circulating strains. Ongoing surveillance, vaccination programs, and educational campaigns are key strategies in the management and control of meningococcal disease globally.

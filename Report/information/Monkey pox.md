Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease caused by the Monkeypox virus, part of the Orthopoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family, which also includes the variola virus (the cause of smallpox), vaccinia virus (used in the smallpox vaccine), and cowpox virus. While my ability to provide the very latest epidemiological data is limited to information prior to April 2023, I can share a comprehensive overview based on the available data up to that point.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Monkeypox was first identified in 1958 in colonies of monkeys kept for research, leading to its name, although rodents are believed to be the natural reservoir of the virus. The first reported human case of Monkeypox was in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), during a period when smallpox had been eliminated in the region but not yet globally. Since then, Monkeypox has been reported in several other central and west African countries.

**Global Prevalence:**
Initially, Monkeypox cases were largely confined to remote regions within the rainforest belts of Central and West Africa, with the majority of cases being reported from the DRC. However, over recent decades, the prevalence and geographic distribution of Monkeypox have expanded. Notably, in 2022, the world witnessed a multi-country outbreak, with cases reported from non-endemic countries, including in Europe, North America, and other regions, signaling a global public health concern.

**Transmission Routes:**
Monkeypox transmission can occur through several routes:
- **Animal-to-human transmission:** Direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals is the primary natural transmission route. Eating inadequately cooked meat of infected animals is also a potential risk.
- **Human-to-human transmission:** This can occur through respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact, or through direct contact with body fluids or lesion material. Indirect contact with lesion material on contaminated items (e.g., clothing or linens) is also possible.
- **Vertical transmission:** from mother to fetus through the placenta, or during close contact during and after birth.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics:**
Historically, Monkeypox primarily affected individuals in central and western African countries where the virus is endemic. However, the recent global outbreak demonstrated that anyone with close contact to an infected person or animal is at risk. The largest burden of disease tends to occur in rural, tropical rainforest regions where there is close contact with infected animals.

**Major Risk Factors:**
Risk factors associated with Monkeypox transmission include:
- Proximity to wildlife, including hunting and consumption of wild game or bush meat.
- Living in or traveling to endemic regions.
- Close contact with individuals infected with the virus.
- Healthcare exposure without appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

**Impact on Regions and Populations:**
The impact of Monkeypox varies significantly between regions:
- In endemic areas, Monkeypox has a high impact on rural communities that engage with wildlife, either through direct contact or through secondary transmission.
- In non-endemic settings, outbreaks may result from travel-related importation of the virus, or they may be amplified in urban areas with close living conditions and health inequalities.

**Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:**
Prevalence rates and affected demographics have varied across outbreaks. In the 2022-2023 global outbreak, for instance, initial cases outside Africa were predominantly identified in men who have sex with men (MSM), though the disease is not sexually transmitted in the traditional sense. This suggested that close, physical contact was a key driver of transmission during that period.

**Control Measures and Public Health Responses:**
Efforts to control the spread of Monkeypox include surveillance, rapid identification and isolation of cases, contact tracing, and promotion of hygiene practices. Vaccination with the smallpox vaccine has been shown to be around 85% effective in preventing Monkeypox and has been used in some instances to control outbreaks. Treatments are limited and primarily supportive, though some antiviral therapies developed for other orthopoxviruses may be effective.

The epidemiological profile of Monkeypox continues to evolve, and updated data from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) should be consulted for the most current information.

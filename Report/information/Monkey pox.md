**Epidemiology of Monkeypox:**

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is part of the Poxviridae family and the Orthopoxvirus genus, which also includes the variola virus that causes smallpox. Monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research, hence the name monkeypox. The first known human case was recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1970, during a period when intensified efforts were made to eliminate smallpox. Since then, monkeypox has been reported in various central and western African countries.

**Global Prevalence:**
For several decades, monkeypox occurred primarily in remote forested areas in central and west Africa, with the DRC having the majority of cases. Its prevalence outside Africa was minimal until the virus saw a significant global spread in 2022, sparking an outbreak of cases in Europe, North America, and other parts of the world. The increase in cases outside Africa raised international concern and called attention to the virus's ability to spread in non-endemic regions.

**Transmission Routes:**
Monkeypox is a zoonosis, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. The virus can spread through:

- Direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals (e.g., rodents and primates).
- Human-to-human transmission, which occurs primarily through large respiratory droplets, direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, and indirectly through contact with lesion-contaminated objects.
- Vertical transmission (from mother to fetus) can also occur, as well as transmission through broken skin, the respiratory tract, eyes, nose, or mouth.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics:**
Initially, monkeypox was mostly seen in certain animal populations of Africa and in people with direct exposure to these animals or their habitats. Most human cases, prior to 2022, were reported from rural, rainforest regions of the Congo Basin, particularly in the DRC, and to a lesser extent in West Africa. The overall case fatality ratio has historically varied greatly by region, from 1% in the West African clade up to 10% in the Congo Basin (Central African) clade.

However, the demographics of affected populations began to shift with the 2022 outbreak, where cases were predominantly reported among younger individuals in non-endemic countries and often among men who have sex with men (MSM), suggesting a pattern of transmission through close, personal contact.

**Major Risk Factors:**
Major risk factors include close contact with infected animals or humans, travel to endemic regions, and exposure in healthcare settings. Other risk factors might be related to specific socio-cultural practices, hunting, and consumption of bushmeat in endemic areas.

**Regional and Population Impact:**
In Africa, monkeypox has had a significant impact on rural communities, which often interact more closely with the wildlife reservoirs of the virus. In terms of global health security, the spread of monkeypox to urban areas and non-endemic countries has demonstrated the virus's potential to exploit opportunities for international transmission.

Monkeypox has placed a particularly heavy burden on healthcare systems that are already strained by other infectious diseases. The appearance of monkeypox in more diverse populations globally has highlighted the necessity for surveillance, rapid diagnostic facilities, and public health campaigns to mitigate the spread.

**Variations in Prevalence and Demographics:**
While case numbers in endemic African countries have slowly increased over decades, likely due to the cessation of smallpox vaccination (which also provided some immunity to monkeypox), the recent multi-country outbreak has shown new patterns in prevalence and demographics. Cases in Western countries have skewed towards specific social networks and contacts, illustrating the importance of understanding cultural and behavioral risk factors in the transmission of zoonotic diseases.

**Conclusion:**
The epidemiology of monkeypox is dynamic, characterized by its zoonotic origin, a propensity for human-to-human transmission under the right conditions, and a capacity to spread internationally. The impact on non-endemic regions has elevated the profile of monkeypox, leading to increases in research, surveillance, and public health efforts to understand and control its spread.

Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the mumps virus, which primarily affects the salivary glands, resulting in swelling and pain in the cheeks and jaws. Additionally, mumps can also affect other organs such as the testes, ovaries, pancreas, and brain.

Historical Context and Discovery:

Mumps has been recognized as a disease for centuries, with historical reports of epidemics describing swollen glands dating back to the 5th century BC. However, it was not until 1934 that the mumps virus was isolated and identified by Johnson and Goodpasture. This discovery established a connection between the mumps virus and the clinical symptoms of the disease.

Global Prevalence and Transmission Routes:

Mumps is found worldwide, but its prevalence varies across regions and populations. Prior to the introduction of the vaccine, mumps was a common childhood disease in many countries. However, widespread vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced the number of cases.

Transmission of mumps occurs through direct contact with respiratory droplets from an infected person, primarily through coughing, sneezing, or sharing utensils, drinks, or other personal items. The virus can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces.

Affected Populations and Key Statistics:

Mumps can affect individuals of all ages, but it is most commonly observed in children aged 5-15 years who have not been vaccinated. However, in recent years, there has been a shift in affected populations, with a rise in cases among adolescents, college students, and young adults.

Key statistics related to mumps include:

1. Incubation Period: The time between exposure to the virus and the development of symptoms ranges from 12 to 25 days, with an average of 16-18 days.
2. Symptomatology: Common symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, and swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands.
3. Complications: Although rare, mumps can lead to various complications, such as meningitis, encephalitis, deafness, orchitis (inflammation of the testicles), oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries), and pancreatitis.
4. Vaccine Availability: Currently, vaccines are available to prevent mumps. The most widely used vaccine is the MMR vaccine, which also provides protection against measles and rubella.

Major Risk Factors Associated with Mumps Transmission:

Several risk factors contribute to the transmission of mumps, including:

1. Lack of Vaccination: Individuals who are not vaccinated or have not received the recommended number of vaccine doses are at a higher risk of contracting and spreading the virus.
2. Crowded Environments: Residing in crowded quarters or close contact settings, such as college dormitories or military barracks, can increase the risk of mumps transmission.
3. International Travel: Visiting or living in areas with low vaccination rates or ongoing mumps outbreaks increases the risk of exposure to the virus.
4. Poor Hygiene Practices: Failure to practice proper hand hygiene, such as not washing hands regularly, can facilitate the spread of the mumps virus.

Impact of Mumps on Different Regions and Populations:

Prevalence rates and demographics affected by mumps can vary across regions and populations due to various factors, including:

1. Vaccination Coverage: Countries with high vaccination coverage generally have lower mumps prevalence rates.
2. Socioeconomic Factors: Improvements in living conditions, access to healthcare, and vaccination infrastructure influence the prevalence and impact of mumps within populations.
3. Age Group: The age group most affected by mumps may differ among regions due to variations in vaccination policies and historical exposure rates.
4. Outbreaks and Clusters: Mumps outbreaks can occur in specific communities, settings, or regions where there is close contact and low vaccination rates, such as schools or religious communities.

In conclusion, mumps is a globally prevalent viral infection that primarily affects the salivary glands. Its transmission occurs through respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected individuals. Although mumps can affect individuals of all ages, children and unvaccinated individuals are at higher risk. Vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced the number of cases, but there are still variations in prevalence rates and affected demographics across regions and populations. Understanding the epidemiology of mumps is crucial for implementing effective prevention and control strategies.
## Introduction

Mumps is a contagious viral disease caused by mumps virus. It spreads easily through the saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person. Symptoms usually appear 16-18 days after exposure and include fever, headache, muscle aches, and pain or swelling in the jaw. Most notably, mumps affects the parotid glands and may lead to complications such as orchitis in males and oophoritis in females if untreated. Vaccination with the MMR vaccine is an effective preventative measure.

## Highlights

1. Mumps cases show a yearly cyclic pattern with peaks around May-June and lesser cases in winter months.<br/>
2. There has been a long-term gradual decrease in cases since 2010, dropping notably after 2020.<br/>
3. Death occurrences are extremely low, indicating adequate healthcare response.<br/>
4. As of September 2023, the disease continues to be sporadic in China but the situation remains manageable.<br/>
5. The sudden drop in cases in 2020 could likely point to factors such as global pandemic measures impacting disease transmission.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported case data for Mumps in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 indicates significant variations across the years but shows a general trend of decrease over time. Prolific outbreaks were observed between the months of May and July for each year, with especially high spikes between 2010 and 2012. This suggests that Mumps cases rise during the warmer months. The data from 2020 onwards shows a drastic drop, with figures remaining below 20,000 cases. This decrease is likely due to the ongoing global health crisis.

### Deaths Analysis
The Mumps mortality rate in mainland China during this period is relatively low when compared to the size of reported cases, suggesting adequate disease management. It is noteworthy that occasional fatalities seem to appear erratically, without a clear pattern or proportion to the number of mumps cases. The highest number of deaths occurred in January 2020, with four reported deaths. It is crucial to do further analysis on these deaths to understand if any external factors contribute to the higher mortality rate.

Mumps is a contagious viral disease caused by the mumps virus, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family. The disease is characterized by fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and most notably, swelling of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands.

### Historical Context and Discovery

Mumps has been recognized as a distinct disease for many centuries. The Greek physician Hippocrates provided the first known written description of mumps in the 5th century BCE. The term "mumps" may originate from an old English dialect, meaning "mumble" or "mump," reflecting the speech difficulties that may occur from the swollen cheeks and jaws.

The mumps virus was not scientifically identified until the early 20th century. Before the introduction of the mumps vaccine, the disease was common, especially in children. It was not until 1945 that Johnson and Goodpasture successfully isolated the mumps virus, paving the way for a vaccine.

### Global Prevalence

Mumps was endemic worldwide prior to the introduction and widespread use of the mumps vaccine. However, since vaccination programs have been implemented, the global prevalence of mumps has decreased significantly. The vaccine is often administered in combination with measles and rubella vaccines, known as the MMR vaccine.

Despite the success of vaccination programs, mumps outbreaks still occur, especially in areas where vaccine coverage is not comprehensive. In some developed countries, there has been a resurgence of mumps, often among young adults in close-contact settings such as schools and colleges.

### Transmission Routes

The mumps virus is highly contagious and is transmitted from person to person primarily through respiratory secretions, such as saliva or mucus from the nose or throat of an infected individual, which can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or talking. The virus can also be spread by sharing items, such as cups or utensils, that are contaminated with the virus.

### Affected Populations and Statistics

Traditionally, mumps primarily affected children between the ages of 5 and 9. However, in the post-vaccination era, the demographic most at risk includes:

- Unvaccinated individuals
- Individuals who live in close-contact settings, such as dormitories or military barracks
- Persons who travel internationally to areas where mumps is more prevalent
- Healthcare workers who are not adequately protected by vaccination

Cases among adults are less common but can occur, especially in populations with waning immunity or in areas with low vaccination rates.

The incidence and prevalence of mumps widely vary from country to country. Many developed countries have seen a significant decrease in cases due to effective vaccination programs. However, occasional outbreaks can lead to a surge in cases, primarily among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals.

### Major Risk Factors

The following are the primary risk factors associated with mumps transmission:
- Lack of vaccination or incomplete vaccination
- Close contact with a person infected with the mumps virus
- International travel to regions where mumps is still prevalent
- Attendance at schools, colleges, or institutions with close-living quarters where the disease can easily spread

### Impact on Different Regions and Populations

The impact of mumps varies:

- **Developed Countries**: In countries with high vaccine coverage, mumps is relatively rare but outbreaks may occur, predominantly affecting adolescents and young adults. For example, the United States has experienced a number of outbreaks among college students.
  
- **Developing Countries**: In regions where vaccine coverage is not widespread or logistical factors limit vaccination efforts, mumps remains a concern and can be more common among children.

### Affected Demographics

Prior to widespread vaccination, young children were the primary demographic affected by mumps. Since vaccination programs have been implemented, the affected demographics have shifted, with outbreaks now more likely to occur among older children, adolescents, and young adults who did not receive the vaccine or whose immunity has decreased over time.

In summary, the epidemiology of mumps has changed dramatically since the development and application of the MMR vaccine. While global prevalence has decreased, it remains an important public health issue, particularly in areas where vaccine uptake is incomplete. Outbreaks, especially in close-contact settings, highlight the need for continued vigilance in vaccination efforts and epidemiological monitoring to control the spread of mumps.

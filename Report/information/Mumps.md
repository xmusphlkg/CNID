Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the mumps virus, which is a member of the genus Rubulavirus in the family of Paramyxoviridae. First described by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC, mumps was a common childhood illness for centuries until the development of a vaccine in the 1960s. The discovery of the mumps virus itself was accomplished in the early 20th century by Claude Henri and colleagues.

**Global Prevalence and Transmission Routes:**
The global prevalence of mumps has significantly declined since the introduction of the mumps vaccine, which is often combined with measles and rubella vaccines (MMR). However, outbreaks still occur, particularly in areas where vaccine uptake is low. Before vaccination programs were implemented, mumps was endemic worldwide. Now, countries with high vaccination coverage have significantly lower incidence rates.

Mumps is primarily spread through respiratory droplets or saliva, which can be transmitted by coughing, sneezing, or talking. It can also spread by sharing utensils or cups with an infected person, or by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth or nose.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics:**
Historically, the affected population was mainly children between the ages of 5 and 9. However, with widespread vaccination practices, the average age of patients has increased, and outbreaks now more commonly affect adolescents and young adults, particularly those in close-contact settings such as schools, colleges, and camps.

Before vaccination, mumps was a leading cause of acquired deafness in children and viral meningitis. Nowadays, incidence rates vary by region and vaccination coverage, with lower prevalence in regions with high vaccine uptake. According to the World Health Organization, seasonal variations can occur, with higher cases reported in winter and spring.

**Risk Factors:**
The major risk factors associated with mumps transmission include:

1. Lack of vaccination or incomplete vaccination.
2. Close-contact settings such as schools, universities, and communal living spaces.
3. International travel to areas where mumps is endemic or where outbreaks are occurring.
4. Being part of a community with low vaccination rates or vaccine hesitancy.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
In regions with high vaccination coverage, such as North America and many parts of Europe, the incidence of mumps is low. However, even in these regions, sporadic outbreaks can occur, especially in populations that have declined the vaccine or in communities with pockets of unvaccinated individuals.

In contrast, developing countries where vaccination coverage is insufficient continue to see higher prevalence rates. The disease can have a serious impact on children's health in these regions due to the complications associated with mumps, such as orchitis, oophoritis, encephalitis, and deafness.

**Affected Demographics:**
While mumps can affect any age group, unvaccinated children and young adults are the most vulnerable to the disease. Additionally, individuals who work in healthcare or educational settings may have a higher risk of exposure.

Vaccination remains the cornerstone of mumps control and prevention. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are typically recommended, providing about 88% protection against mumps. However, vaccine-derived immunity can wane over time, which is one reason why adolescents and young adults—who may have received their last dose years prior—might still experience outbreaks.

Complications from mumps can be serious but are significantly rarer since the advent of the vaccine. These complications might include meningitis, encephalitis, pancreatitis, permanent deafness, and infertility due to orchitis. Vaccination and good hygiene practices remain crucial in combatting the spread of mumps and minimizing its impact on global health.

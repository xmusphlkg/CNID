**Epidemiology of Pertussis:**

**Global Prevalence:**
Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The disease is characterized by severe coughing spells that can last for weeks. Despite the availability of vaccines, pertussis remains a significant public health problem. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there were about 151,074 pertussis cases reported in 2018, but the actual number of cases is likely much higher due to underreporting.

**Transmission Routes:**
Pertussis is transmitted from person to person primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The disease is most contagious during the early stages of the illness and the incubation period, which can be up to 21 days.

**Affected Populations:**
While pertussis can affect individuals of all ages, it is particularly dangerous for infants and young children, who are at risk of severe complications such as apnea, pneumonia, seizures, and death. Older children, adults, and adolescents can also contract pertussis, often with milder symptoms, but they serve as a reservoir for the bacteria and can transmit it to more vulnerable populations.

**Key Statistics:**
Throughout the 20th century, pertussis was one of the leading causes of childhood mortality, but vaccination programs have dramatically reduced its incidence. However, even in countries with high vaccination coverage, pertussis remains endemic with periodic epidemics every 3â€“5 years. Key statistics on the disease, such as case fatality rates and the number of cases, vary widely between regions and depend on the effectiveness of surveillance systems and access to vaccination.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Pertussis has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity since at least the 16th century, but the causative agent, Bordetella pertussis, was not isolated until 1906 by Belgian bacteriologists Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou. The development of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine in the 1940s and its subsequent combination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DTP) led to a decline in the incidence of the disease in countries that implemented vaccination programs.

**Major Risk Factors Associated with Pertussis Transmission:**
1. **Lack of Vaccination:** The primary risk factor for pertussis transmission is lack of vaccination or incomplete vaccination, particularly among infants too young to have received the full course of the DTaP vaccine.
2. **Waning Immunity:** Vaccine-derived immunity can wane over time, making adolescents and adults susceptible to the disease and capable of transmitting it to others, including unvaccinated or under-vaccinated infants.
3. **Close Contact:** Living in crowded conditions or being in close contact with someone who has pertussis increases the risk of transmission.
4. **Age:** Very young infants are at the highest risk for severe disease as they are not fully vaccinated.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
- **Developing Countries:** Pertussis continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, where vaccination coverage may be lower and access to medical care may be limited. The WHO estimates that in 2018, over 60% of pertussis-related deaths occurred in Africa.
- **Developed Countries:** In developed countries, the re-emergence of pertussis among adolescents and adults is a growing concern. Outbreaks are often attributed to the aforementioned waning immunity and the evolution of B. pertussis strains that may be less susceptible to vaccine-induced immunity.
- **Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:** Although all age groups are susceptible, infants who are too young to be vaccinated or who have not completed the vaccination schedule are the most affected demographic with the highest rates of complications and mortality.

In response to the changing epidemiology of pertussis, many countries have introduced booster doses of acellular pertussis vaccines (Tdap) for older children, adolescents, and adults, including pregnant women, to protect newborns. Continuous surveillance, advancing vaccination strategies, and public health education are essential components of efforts to control pertussis globally.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is characterized by severe coughing spells that can last for weeks, potentially leading to serious complications, especially in infants.

**Historical Context and Discovery**

The first clear description of pertussis was given by Guillaume de Baillou in 1578. However, the causative agent, Bordetella pertussis, was not isolated until 1906 by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou. The introduction of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine in the 1940s led to a significant decrease in the incidence of the disease. In later years, due to concerns about side-effects, the whole-cell vaccine was largely replaced by the acellular pertussis vaccine.

**Global Prevalence**

Before widespread vaccination, pertussis was common with periodic epidemics every 2 to 5 years. Today, pertussis remains a significant health concern globally, especially in countries with low vaccination coverage. The WHO estimates hundreds of thousands of cases yearly, with pertussis causing nearly 160,000 deaths worldwide, mainly among young unvaccinated children.

**Transmission Routes**

Pertussis is spread primarily via respiratory droplets exhaled by an infected person through coughing, sneezing, or talking. As the disease is highly infectious, direct contact with an infected person's respiratory secretions or being in close proximity when they cough can facilitate transmission.

**Affected Populations**

Pertussis can affect individuals of all ages but presents the greatest risk to infants who are too young to be vaccinated or who have not yet completed the full vaccine series. Other high-risk groups include pregnant women, healthcare workers, and people with compromised immune systems. In many regions, adolescents and adults are responsible for the transmission to susceptible individuals, as their immunity wanes years after vaccination or previous illness.

**Key Statistics and Major Risk Factors**

The case fatality rate can be as high as 4% in infants, although it is much less in older children and adults. The primary risk factors for the transmission of pertussis include:

- Close contact with an infected person
- Incomplete or lapsed immunization
- Young age, especially neonates and young infants
- Crowded living conditions
- Travel to or living in areas with high infection rates or low vaccination coverage

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations**

While pertussis is a global issue, its prevalence and impact are unevenly distributed. Developing countries with less access to vaccinations and adequate medical care tend to have higher incidence rates and mortality. In contrast, in developed countries where vaccine coverage is high, pertussis is less common, but outbreaks still occur due to waning immunity and pockets of unvaccinated populations.

In regions with higher vaccination coverage, the demography of pertussis patients has shifted from mainly children to include more adolescents and adults. These groups may experience milder symptoms and may not be accurately diagnosed, leading to continued transmission of the disease.

**Variations in Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics**

The demographics of whooping cough have changed since the introduction of the pertussis vaccine. It was primarily a childhood disease, but now there are increasing cases among adolescents and adults. This shift reflects both the success of childhood vaccination programs and the waning immunity over time.

In terms of prevalence, pertussis cases tend to peak in cyclical patterns as immunity in the population wanes and new cohorts of susceptible children are born. Various factors, including differences in healthcare access, surveillance quality, and diagnostic practices, affect reported prevalence rates across different regions.

To prevent pertussis, widespread vaccination is the most effective measure, with booster doses recommended for certain populations to account for waning immunity. Protecting infants through "cocooning" – the strategy of vaccinating those in close contact with infants – and maternal vaccination during pregnancy are additional strategies to prevent infant cases.

Public health efforts continue to focus on improving vaccination coverage, developing new vaccines with longer-lasting immunity, and enhanced surveillance to control the spread of pertussis worldwide.

Plague, also known as the Black Death, is a highly infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis. It has a long history and has caused devastating pandemics worldwide. This comprehensive overview examines the epidemiology of Plague, including its global prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, historical context, and discovery.

1. Global Prevalence:
Plague is naturally found on all continents except Antarctica, but it is most commonly associated with Africa, Asia, and South America. The prevalence of Plague varies over time and across regions. While localized outbreaks are frequent, the global burden of Plague has decreased significantly over the centuries due to improved healthcare systems and public health measures.

2. Transmission Routes:
The primary mode of Plague transmission is zoonotic, meaning it primarily affects animals and can be transmitted to humans. It mainly spreads through the bites of infected fleas that reside on small mammals like rats, squirrels, and prairie dogs. Plague can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals' bodily fluids or tissues, or by inhaling respiratory droplets from individuals with pneumonic Plague.

3. Affected Populations:
Plague can affect people of all ages and genders. Historically, it was associated with poverty, crowded living conditions, and poor sanitation, as these factors increase the chance of coming into contact with infected fleas or animals. Occupations involving close contact with animals, such as farmers, hunters, and veterinarians, traditionally have higher exposure rates.

4. Key Statistics:
- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an average of 1,000 to 2,000 cases of Plague have been reported worldwide in recent years.
- Plague has three forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic Plague is the most common, accounting for around 80-95% of cases.
- Mortality rates vary based on the form. Bubonic Plague has a mortality rate of about 30-60% if left untreated, while septicemic and pneumonic Plague are more severe, with mortality rates of 100% if not treated promptly.
- Madagascar reports the highest number of Plague cases annually, with periodic outbreaks between September and April. Other countries reporting Plague cases include Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Madagascar.

5. Historical Context and Discovery:
Plague has a documented history dating back thousands of years, with the first recorded pandemic occurring during the Byzantine Empire in the 6th century AD. The most infamous pandemic, the Black Death, ravaged Europe in the 14th century, killing an estimated 75-200 million people and causing profound societal, economic, and cultural impacts.
The discovery of Plague's causative agent, Yersinia pestis, is credited to Alexandre Yersin, a Swiss-French physician, in 1894. His groundbreaking work paved the way for understanding the disease and developing effective treatments and preventive measures.

6. Major Risk Factors:
- Close contact with rodents or their fleas.
- Poor sanitation and hygiene conditions.
- Living or working in areas with high Plague prevalence.
- Traveling to Plague-affected regions.
- Participating in activities involving close contact with infected animals or fleas.

7. Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
Regions and populations with limited access to healthcare resources, poor sanitation, and high exposure to rodents or fleas are most susceptible to Plague outbreaks. Additionally, factors such as climate change, urbanization, and natural disasters can contribute to the spread and impact of Plague. Populations living in poverty and overcrowded conditions remain at greater risk worldwide.

In conclusion, Plague continues to pose a threat to certain regions and populations, although its global prevalence has significantly decreased over time. Understanding the epidemiology of Plague, including its transmission routes, affected populations, and risk factors, is crucial for implementing effective prevention and control measures to mitigate its impact.
## Introduction

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. This zoonotic disease primarily affects rodents like rats and is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas. Plague presents in three forms - bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, each carrying varying severity and symptoms. Historically, plague caused widespread pandemics, including the Black Death in the 14th century. Despite antibiotic treatment, plague can be lethal if not treated promptly, hence emphasizing preventive measures.

## Highlights

1. There is a tendency of reported Plague cases and deaths to occur in sporadic, isolated instances, with majority of the months reporting zero cases or deaths.<br/>
2. Years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2017, 2019, 2020, and 2022 witnessed both cases and deaths in the same month, suggestive of severe disease periods.<br/>
3. September 2023 marked a quiet period, with no reported cases or deaths, following a bump in cases (and deaths) in August 2023, keep monitoring for potential resurgences.<br/>
4. There is no clear seasonal pattern, however, some cases/deaths appear around mid-year (July), and late-year (September to November).

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the reported period of 13 years, Plague cases in mainland China appear to be sporadic and infrequent, with most months reporting zero cases. Some notable spikes in cases are found in October 2011, October 2014, November 2019, and August 2023, with 2, 2, 4, and 4 cases reported respectively. The months that consistently show a slight increase in cases tend to be mid-year and towards the end of the year, indicating possible seasonality in the occurrence of plague cases. 

### Deaths Analysis 
In terms of fatalities, the data shows that the mortality rate is relatively high for reported cases. Out of the 23 reported cases of plague, there were 10 deaths, indicating a case fatality ratio of approximately 43%. This suggests that while the incidence of Plague is low, the disease severity is high. Notably, the two peak case months, November 2019, and August 2023, had zero and one death(s) respectively, which may suggest improved case management or reporting inaccuracies.

### Historical Context and Discovery of Plague:

Plague is a disease that has affected humanity throughout historical and prehistorical times. The most notorious plague outbreak was the Black Death in the 14th century, which killed an estimated 50 million people in Europe, approximately one-third of the continent's population. Caused by the bacterium *Yersinia pestis*, plague was historically transmitted via fleabites, from person to person, and through other routes, leading to devastating pandemics.

The discovery of the plague bacterium is attributed to the bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin during an 1894 Hong Kong outbreak, which led to a better understanding of the disease. Subsequent scientific advancements allowed for the development of antibiotics, which markedly reduced the lethality and incidence of the disease.

### Global Prevalence:

The global prevalence of plague has dramatically decreased since the advent of modern sanitation and antibiotics. However, outbreaks still occur, primarily in rural areas in specific regions of the world. Modern cases of plague are predominantly reported from Africa (especially the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Madagascar), Asia, and the Americas (USA and Peru). WHO reports that there are a few thousand cases annually, but due to under-reporting and surveillance issues, the actual numbers might be higher.

### Transmission Routes:

Plague can be transmitted in several ways:

1. **Flea Bites**: The most common route of transmission to humans is through the bite of an infected flea. The bacterium lives in small mammals like rats, prairie dogs, and squirrels, with fleas serving as vectors that can transmit the bacterium to humans.

2. **Direct Contact**: Humans can contract the bubonic or septicemic form of plague through direct contact with tissue or bodily fluids of an infected animal.

3. **Inhalation**: Pneumonic plague, the most serious form, can be transmitted from person to person through infected respiratory droplets.

4. **Contaminated Materials**: Handling contaminated materials, such as clothing or linen from infected individuals, can also result in transmission.

### Affected Populations and Key Statistics:

Most human cases in the modern era occur in rural areas where people live in close proximity to infected rodents and fleas. Specific populations might be at higher risk due to close interaction with vector species (for hunting, etc.) or environmental conditions that encourage the proliferation of rodents.

### Major Risk Factors:

1. **Environmental Factors**: Regions that experience natural disasters, poor sanitation, and high rodent populations can facilitate the spread of plague.

2. **Occupational Exposure**: Veterinarians and wildlife workers may be at higher risk due to their direct contact with potentially infected animals.

3. **Proximity to Vectors**: People living near or venturing into areas with large rodent populations have heightened risk.

4. **Socio-economic Factors**: Low-income regions with less developed healthcare systems are at an increased risk of outbreaks and less effective disease control.

### Impact on Different Regions and Populations:

The impact of plague depends on various factors, including local public health capabilities, state of infrastructure, and the immediate response to any outbreak.

1. **Africa**: Reports the highest number of cases, with Madagascar experiencing frequent outbreaks, often marked by high mortality rates.

2. **Asia**: Historical pandemics originated in Asia, and some countries still report occasional cases, but with much-reduced frequency and severity.

3. **The Americas**: Particularly in the western United States and some regions of South America, there are sporadic cases, often related to outdoor activities that bring humans into contact with infected wildlife or fleas.

### Variations in Prevalence Rates and Affected Demographics:

Plague cases have a geographic and demographic pattern that generally corresponds to the presence and interaction of humans with potential vectors and reservoirs. However, due to the great rarity of plague in the contemporary period compared to historical pandemics, broad patterns of prevalence are difficult to ascertain beyond the aforementioned risks linked to occupation, geography, and socio-economic status.

It's important to note that with global climate changes and shifting human-animal interfaces, the risk of plague outbreaks may also shift temporally and geographically. Public health measures and awareness are critical in preventing potential re-emergence or spread of the disease in regions where plague is still extant.

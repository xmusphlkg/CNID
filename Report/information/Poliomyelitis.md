Poliomyelitis, commonly referred to as polio, is an infectious viral disease caused by the poliovirus. Primarily affecting children under the age of five, polio can lead to lifelong paralysis or even death. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of poliomyelitis, including its epidemiology, global prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, historical context and discovery, major risk factors, and impact on different regions and populations.

Global Prevalence:
Prior to the introduction of the polio vaccine, poliomyelitis was a significant global health concern, with large outbreaks occurring worldwide. However, with the development and widespread use of vaccines, the prevalence of polio has significantly decreased. Currently, polio remains endemic only in two countries: Afghanistan and Pakistan. Occasionally, other countries experience outbreaks due to virus importation, but these are typically contained swiftly.

Transmission Routes:
The poliovirus primarily spreads through the fecal-oral route, meaning it is usually transmitted through contaminated food, water, or surfaces. Infection occurs when individuals ingest fecal matter containing the virus or when they come into contact with secretions from an infected person's mouth or nose. Respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing by infected individuals can also contribute to the spread.

Affected Populations:
While poliomyelitis can affect people of any age, children under five are particularly vulnerable. The virus mainly targets the nervous system, resulting in muscle weakness, paralysis, and potential lifelong disability. Socioeconomic factors, such as inadequate sanitation, lack of safe drinking water, and limited access to healthcare services, contribute to increased risk of polio transmission in low-income and developing countries.

Key Statistics:
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), global polio cases have decreased by over 99% since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988. In 2020, only 140 cases were reported worldwide. However, it is crucial to note that these figures exclude cases in countries where polio remains endemic.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Poliomyelitis has been recognized as a disease for thousands of years. However, its true nature was not understood until the late 19th century. The United States experienced its first major polio epidemic in 1916, resulting in thousands of cases and deaths. It was not until the 1950s that vaccines were developed for polio prevention. The introduction of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and the oral polio vaccine (OPV) significantly reduced global polio cases.

Major Risk Factors:
Risk factors associated with the transmission of poliomyelitis include residing in areas with inadequate sanitation infrastructure, lack of access to safe drinking water, and low vaccination coverage. Polio is more likely to spread in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, such as refugee camps or areas affected by natural disasters. Furthermore, individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with malnutrition or HIV/AIDS, face a higher risk of paralysis if infected with the poliovirus.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
In regions where polio remains endemic, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, the disease poses significant public health challenges. Factors such as conflict, social barriers, and religious or cultural beliefs contribute to ongoing polio transmission in these areas. The impact of polio varies among populations depending on their access to healthcare services and immunization coverage. Minority and marginalized populations, including migrants and refugees, often bear a disproportionate burden of polio due to limited healthcare access and lower vaccination rates.

In conclusion, poliomyelitis, also known as polio, is a viral disease that primarily affects children under the age of five. The global prevalence of polio has greatly decreased due to widespread vaccination efforts. Polio is mainly transmitted through contaminated food, water, and surfaces. Inadequate sanitation, limited access to safe drinking water, and deficient healthcare services contribute to the risk of transmission. While polio remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan, ongoing vaccination efforts aim to eradicate the disease.

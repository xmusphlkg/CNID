Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is an acute viral infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Historically, polio was one of the most feared diseases, leading to widespread epidemics throughout the world and causing paralysis and death in many, particularly among children.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Polio has been known since ancient times, with descriptions of the disease appearing in Egyptian art. However, major outbreaks became more common in Europe and the United States towards the end of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. The virus causing poliomyelitis was first isolated in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper.

**Global Prevalence:**
The global prevalence of poliomyelitis has dramatically decreased thanks to the widespread use of polio vaccines—introduced by Jonas Salk (inactivated polio vaccine, IPV, in 1955) and Albert Sabin (oral polio vaccine, OPV, in 1961). The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), launched in 1988, has led to a significant reduction in cases, with polio reportedly being endemic in only two countries—Pakistan and Afghanistan—as of my knowledge cut-off date.

**Transmission Routes:**
Polio is highly contagious and transmits primarily via the fecal-oral route, although oral-oral transmission is also possible. It can spread through direct contact with an infected person, or less commonly, through contaminated food and water. The virus multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system.

**Affected Populations:**
While polio can infect persons of any age, children under five years old are the most vulnerable to the disease, especially those living in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices.

**Key Statistics and Risk Factors:**
- The virus has an incubation period of 6-20 days, with a range of possible symptoms, from mild flu-like illness to severe paralysis.
- Approximately one in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis, usually in the legs. Among those paralyzed, 5-10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized.
- Risk factors for transmission include lack of immunization, poor sanitation, malnutrition, and traveling to or living in areas where polio is endemic or where vaccination coverage is low.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
The impact of polio varies by geographical region:

- **Developed Countries:** In countries with high hygiene standards and comprehensive immunization programs, polio cases have been virtually eliminated. Occasional imported cases may occur.
  
- **Developing Countries:** Before widespread vaccination, developing countries with less robust sanitation infrastructure experienced endemic polio. Due to intensive vaccination campaigns over the past decades, the incidence has decreased dramatically.
  
- **Conflict Zones and Remote Areas:** Ongoing conflicts and hard-to-reach locations provide challenges for polio vaccination campaigns, leading to increased risks of outbreaks.

Even though polio has been brought to the brink of eradication, it is critical to maintain high immunization coverage to prevent its resurgence. As a polio-free status requires not only no reported cases but also no presence of the virus in the environment (as detected in sewage water, for example), vigilance and continued surveillance are crucial. Additionally, the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) strains poses a risk that requires constant monitoring and rapid response measures. 

In conclusion, ongoing vaccination efforts, improved sanitation, surveillance, and targeted responses to outbreaks in vulnerable areas are vital components of the global strategy to ensure the complete eradication of poliomyelitis.

Rabies is a viral disease that causes encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord) and is typically fatal once clinical symptoms appear. The disease is caused by lyssaviruses, with the most important and common being the Rabies virus (RABV). Here's a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of rabies:

**Global Prevalence:**
Rabies is a zoonotic disease, meaning it is transmitted to humans from animals. It is present on all continents except Antarctica, with over 95% of human deaths occurring in Asia and Africa. Globally, it is estimated that rabies causes 59,000 human deaths annually. Rabies in dogs is the principal source of human infection, contributing up to 99% of all transmissions to humans.

**Transmission Routes:**
The virus is most commonly transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. It can also be transmitted if saliva from an infected animal comes into contact with open cuts or mucous membranes (such as the eyes, nose, or mouth). Though rare, transmission can occur through organ transplants.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics:**
Children are particularly at risk, with a large proportion of rabies fatalities occurring in individuals under the age of 15. This is often due to children being more likely to approach animals and less likely to report bites. Dog-mediated rabies accounts for tens of thousands of deaths each year, primarily in regions where canine rabies is endemic and vaccination programs for dogs are not adequately implemented.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Evidence of rabies dates back to antiquity, with descriptions of rabid dogs in various ancient civilizations. The term "rabies" is derived from the Latin word "rabere," meaning to rage or rave, which reflects the behavior of animals affected by the disease. The virus itself was first isolated and identified by the French chemists Louis Pasteur and Ã‰mile Roux in the 19th century. Pasteur developed the first effective rabies vaccine in 1885, which is still considered one of the greatest achievements in modern medicine.

**Major Risk Factors for Rabies Transmission:**
- Contact with wild animals, especially bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes in some regions.
- Contact with stray dogs or cats in regions where rabies is endemic in the canine population.
- Lack of access to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes wound cleansing, rabies immunoglobulin, and vaccination.
- Inadequate vaccination coverage in domestic animals, particularly dogs, which is the most substantial reservoir for human infections.
- Engaging with wildlife or domestic animals while traveling in regions where rabies is common.
- Working in close contact with animals (e.g., veterinarians, wildlife professionals).

**Impact of Rabies on Different Regions and Populations:**
The prevalence of rabies can vary greatly among different regions:

- **Asia and Africa** experience the highest burden, with India alone reporting approximately one-third of global human rabies deaths.
- **Americas** have largely controlled rabies through extensive dog vaccination programs, with only sporadic cases reported, primarily transmitted by bats or other wildlife.
- **Europe and Oceania** see very few cases due to effective animal control and vaccination programs. Some cases in Europe are wildlife-associated (e.g., bat transmissions).

The demographics most affected are generally those living in rural areas with inadequate access to health services and education about rabies prevention. Children are more susceptible to animal bites and less able to fend off an attacking animal.

In conclusion, rabies is a preventable disease, with the reduction in global incidence reliant on controlling the disease in the primary animal reservoirs (domestic dogs), increasing awareness about the risks and transmission, improving access to PEP, and international cooperation to maintain surveillance and implement effective intervention strategies.

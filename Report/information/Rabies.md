Rabies is a viral disease that causes encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord) in mammals, including humans, and is usually fatal once clinical symptoms appear. The virus that causes rabies is a lyssavirus, and it affects the central nervous system, ultimately leading to disease in the brain and death.

**Global Prevalence:**
Rabies is found on all continents except Antarctica, but more than 95% of human deaths occur in Asia and Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tens of thousands of people die from rabies each year, with most cases occurring in rural areas where access to medical care and vaccination is limited. Dogs are the main source of human rabies deaths, contributing up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans.

**Transmission Routes:**
Transmission typically occurs through the bite of an infected animal, with dogs being the most common transmitter to humans. The virus is present in the saliva of an infected animal and enters the host's body through broken skin or mucous membranes. Other routes, though rare, can include scratches, organ transplants, and inhalation of aerosolized virus particles (for example, in bat caves).

**Affected Populations:**
Those most at risk are individuals who work closely with animals, such as veterinarians and wildlife professionals, and those living in regions with high stray dog populations and limited access to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and vaccination. Children are particularly vulnerable due to their playful nature and small size, which may lead to more severe bites and being less likely to report minor bites or scratches.

**Key Statistics:**
- Globally, rabies causes an estimated 59,000 human deaths annually.
- Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis is nearly 100% effective when administered promptly and correctly.
- Despite being vaccine-preventable, rabies remains a significant concern due to underreporting and lack of access to healthcare in many regions.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Rabies is one of the oldest recognized diseases, with records dating back to ancient civilizations. The etymology traces back to languages like Sanskrit, meaning "to do violence," reflecting the manifestations of animal behavior when infected. In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur and Emile Roux developed the first successful rabies vaccination. Pasteur famously treated a young boy named Joseph Meister, who had been bitten by a rabid dog, with his experimental vaccine, marking a significant milestone in the medical management of the disease.

**Major Risk Factors:**
- Contact with wild and domestic animals in rabies-endemic areas.
- Bites or scratches from infected animals, particularly in regions with high populations of stray dogs.
- Limited public health resources and access to healthcare, resulting in insufficient vaccination coverage.
- Lack of awareness and education about rabies and preventive measures.
- Engagement in activities that increase the risk of wildlife encounters, such as spelunking in areas with bat populations, which might harbor the virus.

**Regional and Population Impact:**
While rabies is a global concern, the impact and prevalence rates vary significantly by region:
- In developed countries, rabies is relatively rare in domestic animals and the majority of the cases come from wildlife reservoirs like bats, raccoons, and foxes.
- In developing countries, canine rabies is still endemic, and the lack of infrastructure for animal control and vaccination programs contributes to higher prevalence and transmission rates.
- Vulnerable populations in these areas are disproportionately affected due to a combination of factors, including limited access to preventive measures and post-exposure treatments.

Vaccination of domestic animals, particularly dogs, is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in humans. To address the global burden of rabies, international organizations, including WHO, are working toward its control and elimination through programs that focus on increasing awareness, vaccination campaigns, and improving access to post-exposure prophylaxis.

**Affected Demographics:**
Children in rabies-endemic regions represent a significant proportion of the victims due to their behavior and height, which makes their facial areas more accessible to dogs. Males have historically been shown to have a higher incidence of rabies, potentially due to increased exposure through occupational or behavioral factors. 

Efforts to combat rabies involve coordinated public health strategies, including vaccination campaigns for animals, widespread public education, and improved access to healthcare and post-exposure prophylaxis. Despite such efforts, the disease remains a serious threat in many low-resource countries, highlighting the need for ongoing global public health interventions.

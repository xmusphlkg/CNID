SARS-CoV refers to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, which is the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. Below is a comprehensive overview of its epidemiology, including historical context, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, risk factors, and its global impact.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
- The SARS-CoV outbreak started in November 2002 when the first cases were identified in the Guangdong province of southern China. 
- The causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus in 2003 and was later named SARS-CoV. 
- The virus jumped from animals to humans, with horseshoe bats suspected to be the natural reservoir and masked palm civets as the intermediate hosts.

**Global Prevalence:**
- SARS-CoV quickly spread to 26 countries around the world before it was contained in July 2003.
- There were 8,098 reported cases of SARS, with 774 confirmed deaths, leading to a case-fatality rate of approximately 9.6%. 
- The outbreak was predominantly contained to East Asia and Canada in terms of significant clusters of cases.

**Transmission Routes:**
- SARS-CoV was primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets.
- The virus could also spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, which includes the mouth, nose, or eyes. 
- Droplet transmission required close contact, typically within one meter of a person who is coughing or sneezing.
- Aerosol-generating procedures in healthcare settings have also led to airborne transmission.

**Affected Populations:**
- Healthcare workers represented a significant proportion of SARS cases due to their close contact with patients.
- Individuals with underlying health conditions, the elderly, and the immunocompromised were more susceptible to severe disease and death.

**Key Statistics:**
- The World Health Organization (WHO) provided regular updates on case and death counts during the outbreak.
- The majority of cases were in mainland China and Hong Kong.
- The high basic reproduction number (R0) of 2-4 suggested the potential for rapid spread in the absence of control measures.

**Major Risk Factors for Transmission:**
- Close contact with symptomatic individuals, particularly in healthcare settings.
- Exposure to wet markets selling live animals in China was identified as a significant risk factor for initial zoonotic transmission.
- Travel to affected regions contributed to the international spread of the virus.
- Poor infection control practices increased nosocomial transmission.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
- Asia bore the brunt of the epidemic with the highest absolute case numbers, largely due to the density of urban populations and the intersection of humans with animal vectors.
- Toronto, Canada was notably affected outside of Asia, experiencing a significant outbreak that profoundly impacted their health system and communities due to nosocomial spread.
- Variations in prevalence rates were seen based on the capacity of public health response, travel patterns, and socio-economic factors.

**Prevention and Control Measures:**
- The control of the SARS outbreak was largely due to effective public health interventions, such as case detection and isolation, quarantine measures, travel advisories, and community engagement.
- No SARS-CoV vaccine was created as the virus was contained before one became necessary.
- After the containment of the outbreak, surveillance and research continued to prepare for the possibility of the virus re-emerging and to inform the response to future similar epidemics, like the later COVID-19 pandemic which was caused by SARS-CoV-2, a related betacoronavirus.

Itâ€™s worth noting that since its containment in 2003, there have been no known cases of SARS-CoV transmission anywhere in the world. The epidemiology of SARS-CoV is a foundational case study that has informed responses to similar outbreaks, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the global response to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

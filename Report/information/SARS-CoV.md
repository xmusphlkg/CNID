Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the virus responsible for the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that first emerged in Guangdong province of southern China in November 2002. The SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 was a pivotal moment in the history of emerging infectious diseases, as it marked the first severe and readily transmissible new disease of the 21st century.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
SARS-CoV is a novel coronavirus (CoV) that was not previously identified in humans. In early 2003, after the spread of the disease to various countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert. The virus was identified in April 2003, and a network of laboratories collaborated to share information which led to the rapid identification of the etiology of SARS.

**Global Prevalence and Transmission Routes:**
The SARS outbreak affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8,000 cases. The overall mortality rate was estimated to be about 10%, with over 770 deaths worldwide. Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV occurred primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Direct contact with infected surfaces and objects (fomites) as well as fecal-oral routes were also implicated.

**Affected Populations:**
SARS affected individuals of various age groups, and the risk increased with age. Health care workers were particularly at risk due to their close contact with patients. Factors such as underlying health conditions and immunosuppression were also associated with more severe outcomes.

**Key Statistics:**
- More than 8,000 reported cases.
- Around 10% case fatality rate.
- Disproportionate impact on health care workers.
- Incubation period typically 2 to 7 days, but could be as long as 10 days.

**Major Risk Factors:**
- Close person-to-person contact with symptomatic individuals, especially in health care settings.
- Exposure to aerosolized respiratory secretions.
- Living with or caring for a SARS patient.
- Travel to affected areas during the outbreak.
- Superspreader events, where one individual transmits the virus to a disproportionately large number of contacts.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
- Asia was the hardest-hit continent during the SARS outbreak, with the majority of cases occurring in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore.
- Canada experienced a significant outbreak, with Toronto being the epicenter of the country's cases.
- Different demographics, such as the elderly and those with comorbidities, experienced higher morbidity and mortality. 

Following the outbreak, international guidelines and health regulations were tightened to better monitor and respond to respiratory illnesses with potential for global spread. Screening and isolation procedures in airports and hospitals played a fundamental part in curtailing the disease.

It is important to differentiate SARS-CoV from other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic beginning in late 2019. While they share similarity in their genetic material and disease manifestations, their epidemiological characteristics differ considerably, with SARS-CoV-2 having a much broader global impact than SARS-CoV.

After the containment of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, no cases of SARS have been reported worldwide. The success in controlling the SARS epidemic was the result of effective international collaboration, stringent infection control practices, and public health measures, including the utilization of quarantine. The lessons learned from the SARS outbreak have been crucial in shaping responses to subsequent infectious disease threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

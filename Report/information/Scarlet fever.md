Scarlet fever is an infectious disease caused by a bacterial infection of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria, specifically Streptococcus pyogenes. It is characterized by a rash, fever, sore throat, and swollen tonsils. Scarlet fever is a globally prevalent disease with outbreaks occurring in many parts of the world. It is essential to understand the epidemiology, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, historical context, and associated risk factors in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies.

Transmission of scarlet fever occurs through respiratory droplets when infected individuals cough or sneeze. Direct contact with infected nasal or throat fluids can also lead to transmission. The bacteria can survive on surfaces for a short period, contributing to indirect transmission. Poor hygiene practices and overcrowded living conditions can exacerbate transmission.

Scarlet fever affects individuals of all ages, but it is most commonly found in children aged 5 to 15 years. Younger children, aged 2 to 4 years, are also susceptible due to their lack of immunity and less robust immune systems compared to adults. While scarlet fever is less common in infants and adults, they can still contract the disease.

The historical context of scarlet fever dates back centuries, with documented cases as early as the 16th century. However, it was not until the late 19th century that researchers identified the connection between scarlet fever and GAS bacteria. In 1878, German physician Friedrich von Hebra proposed the bacterial cause, and in 1884, German physician Gerhard Domagk discovered a specific strain of Streptococcus pyogenes responsible for scarlet fever.

Scarlet fever has demonstrated variations in prevalence rates and affected demographics across different regions. In recent years, there has been a global increase in cases, with significant outbreaks reported in China, South Korea, and Hong Kong. In the United States, scarlet fever rates have fluctuated over time, with periodic increases and decreases. Certain regions, such as the East and Southeast regions, have observed higher rates of the disease.

Various factors contribute to the transmission and impact of scarlet fever. Close contact with infected individuals, especially in school or daycare settings, increases the risk of transmission. Poor hygiene practices, such as inadequate handwashing and sharing contaminated objects, also contribute to the spread. Overcrowded living conditions, low socioeconomic status, and limited access to healthcare services can worsen the impact of the disease in certain populations.

The impact of scarlet fever can vary depending on the region and affected population. Complications associated with scarlet fever can range from mild to severe, including pneumonia, ear infections, sinusitis, and toxic shock syndrome. The disease can also lead to long-term complications such as rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis.

In conclusion, scarlet fever is a globally prevalent infectious disease caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Its transmission occurs through respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected fluids. Children and young adults are the most commonly affected populations. Understanding the epidemiology, transmission routes, affected populations, and associated risk factors is crucial for developing effective prevention and control strategies, especially in regions with higher prevalence rates and vulnerable demographics.
## Introduction

Scarlet fever, also known as scarlatina, is a potentially serious bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria. It is characterized by a distinctive pink-red rash, high fever, a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, swollen glands, nausea, headache, body aches, and the signature "strawberry tongue". Scarlet fever typically affects children between five and 15 but can occur at any age. It is spread through close contact with an infected person's respiratory droplets and is primarily treatable with antibiotics.

## Highlights

1. Notable decline in Scarlet fever cases since 2019: Scarlet fever displayed a marked decline since the start of 2019, particularly from 2020 onwards. The total reported cases per month dropped significantly, potentially indicative of successful control measures.<br/>
2. Lower severity in recent years: The data demonstrates a considerable reduction in Scarlet fever-related deaths, with very few reported incidents since 2010.<br/>
3. Periodic increase typically in colder months: There's a consistent cyclical pattern with the number of cases increasing in colder months (November to January) annually.<br/>
4. In September 2023, Scarlet Fever had 1546 cases, continuing the trend of lowered severity.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The total cases of Scarlet fever in mainland, China have fluctuated over the years from 2010 to 2023. A distinct seasonal pattern can be observed with the number of cases peaking between May and June each year, and decreasing between December and April. Considerable increases in cases were seen in 2011 and 2018, with monthly cases reaching nearly 10,000 during peak months. A significant decrease is observed in 2020 and 2021, most likely due to improved public health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequent months and years started showing a rise in cases, though at a lower magnitude than pre-2020 levels.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the 13-year timeframe, there have been very few recorded deaths from Scarlet fever, with only five on record. The first death occurred in July 2011, with subsequent fatalities in May and July 2012, December 2013, and September 2020. Despite varying number of cases each year, the fatality rate of Scarlet fever in mainland, China is exceptionally low, suggesting effective disease management strategies are in place.

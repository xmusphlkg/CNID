Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. It affects approximately 240 million people worldwide, primarily in tropical and subtropical countries with inadequate access to clean water and proper sanitation. Schistosomiasis is considered the second most prevalent parasitic disease globally, following malaria.

Discovery and Historical Context:
Schistosomiasis has a long history, with evidence of infection found in ancient Egyptian mummies dating back over 4,000 years. The disease was further described in Chinese medical texts from the 2nd century BC. It gained attention in the 19th century when Theodore Bilharz, a German physician, discovered and described the parasitic worm responsible for the disease. Since then, extensive research has been conducted on the epidemiology, transmission, and control of schistosomiasis.

Prevalence:
Schistosomiasis is endemic in 78 countries, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South America, and parts of Southeast Asia. It disproportionately affects marginalized and disadvantaged populations living in poverty without access to safe water sources and adequate sanitation. It is estimated that over 90% of the global burden occurs in sub-Saharan Africa.

Transmission Routes:
Schistosomiasis transmission occurs when people come into contact with contaminated freshwater bodies such as rivers, lakes, or ponds that harbor intermediate host snails. The parasitic worms release larvae into the water, which penetrate the skin of humans during activities like swimming, bathing, or washing clothes. The larvae then mature into adult worms, residing in the veins surrounding the bladder or intestine, depending on the species of Schistosoma involved.

Key Statistics:
- Approximately 240 million people worldwide are infected with schistosomiasis.
- Over 700 million people are at risk of infection and require preventive treatment.
- Schistosomiasis is responsible for an estimated 200,000 deaths annually.
- It is one of the leading causes of morbidity and disability in affected regions.

Major Risk Factors:
Several factors increase the risk of schistosomiasis transmission:
1. Poor sanitation: Lack of access to clean water, proper sanitation, and hygienic practices contribute to the spread of the disease.
2. Agricultural and occupational exposure: Activities such as farming, fishing, and irrigation often involve close contact with contaminated water sources, increasing the risk of infection.
3. Poverty and social determinants: Individuals from impoverished communities are more vulnerable due to inadequate access to healthcare, education, and resources for sanitation.
4. Water-related activities: Frequent exposure to freshwater bodies, such as swimming or washing clothes, increases the likelihood of contracting the infection.
5. Geographical factors: Certain areas where intermediate host snails are prevalent, such as slow-flowing or stagnant freshwater, are more prone to transmission.

Impact on Regions and Populations:
Schistosomiasis has a significant impact on affected regions and populations. In endemic areas, the disease affects both children and adults, leading to chronic illness, anemia, cognitive impairments, and reduced productivity. In children, it can impair growth and cognitive development, affecting educational performance. Female genital schistosomiasis, a specific form of the infection, can lead to infertility and complications during pregnancy.

Prevalence Rates and Demographics:
Schistosomiasis prevalence rates vary among different regions and populations. Sub-Saharan Africa experiences the highest burden, with countries like Nigeria, Tanzania, and Sudan reporting particularly high prevalence. In some endemic areas, prevalence rates can reach 70-80% among school-aged children. However, there are variations within countries, with higher rates often found in rural communities compared to urban areas. In other regions, such as Brazil and Egypt, localized foci of transmission exist, primarily affecting specific communities in rural areas.

In conclusion, schistosomiasis is a chronic and widespread parasitic disease affecting millions of people worldwide, primarily in low-income settings. Lack of access to clean water, poor sanitation, and specific occupational activities are major risk factors. The disease has significant health and socioeconomic impacts, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Efforts to control and prevent schistosomiasis require a comprehensive approach, including health education, access to clean water, improved sanitation, mass drug administration, and snail control programs.

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. It is estimated that over 240 million people worldwide are affected by this disease, with approximately 700 million people at risk of infection. Schistosomiasis is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in poor communities without access to clean water and adequate sanitation.

The disease is transmitted through contact with contaminated freshwater where certain species of freshwater snails act as intermediate hosts for the parasite. When individuals come into contact with infested water, the parasite's larvae, known as cercariae, penetrate the skin and migrate to the blood vessels surrounding the intestines or bladder. There, they mature into adult worms, which can live in the host for several years, producing eggs that are excreted in the urine or feces, perpetuating the transmission cycle.

Schistosomiasis affects a wide range of populations, but the highest burden is found among children and young adults who are exposed to infested water during daily activities such as bathing, swimming, or farming. Occupational exposure is also common among farmers, fishermen, and irrigation workers. Additionally, women and girls are at increased risk due to domestic activities like washing clothes and fetching water.

Key statistics related to schistosomiasis include:

1. Prevalence: Schistosomiasis is endemic in 78 countries, with the highest burden found in sub-Saharan Africa, but it also affects parts of South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Asia.
2. Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs): The disease results in significant morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 1.9 million DALYs lost annually.
3. Mortality: Schistosomiasis is responsible for approximately 200,000 deaths each year, primarily due to complications such as liver fibrosis, bladder cancer, and kidney failure.
4. Co-infections: Schistosomiasis often coexists with other neglected tropical diseases, such as malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, exacerbating the overall burden of disease.
5. Economic impact: The disease has severe socioeconomic consequences, hindering agricultural productivity and limiting educational attainment and economic development in affected regions.

The historical context of schistosomiasis dates back to ancient Egypt, where evidence of infection was found in mummies dating back to 2,500 BCE. However, it was not until the early 20th century that the parasite responsible for schistosomiasis was discovered. In 1904, a German physician named Theodor Bilharz identified the parasite in autopsies of Egyptian patients, leading to the disease being named after him. Further research was conducted by British scientists Sir Patrick Manson and Sir Ronald Ross, who contributed to our understanding of the parasite's life cycle and transmission.

The major risk factors associated with schistosomiasis transmission include:

1. Poor sanitation and lack of clean water: Access to clean water sources and adequate sanitation facilities is crucial in preventing contact with contaminated freshwater and reducing the risk of infection.
2. Poverty and resource-limited settings: Schistosomiasis is most prevalent in areas with limited resources, where infrastructure for water and sanitation is lacking, and health services are often inadequate.
3. Lack of awareness and education: Communities with low levels of health literacy and awareness regarding the transmission and prevention of schistosomiasis are more vulnerable to infection.
4. Environmental factors: The presence of suitable freshwater habitats for the intermediate host snails, such as slow-flowing rivers, lakes, and irrigation systems, increases the likelihood of transmission.
5. Occupational exposure: Certain occupations, such as agriculture, fishing, and irrigation work, involve regular contact with infested water, increasing the risk of infection.
6. Gender-related factors: Women and girls may face a higher risk due to domestic activities that involve contact with infested water, as well as cultural practices that limit their access to education and healthcare.

The impact of schistosomiasis varies across different regions and populations. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the greatest burden, with approximately 90% of global cases occurring in this region. In some areas, such as Mali, Niger, and Sudan, prevalence rates can exceed 50% in certain communities. In contrast, the disease is now considered eliminated or controlled in several regions, including parts of China and the Caribbean.

Prevalence rates also differ within countries, with higher rates often found in rural and marginalized communities where access to clean water and sanitation infrastructure is limited. Children are particularly vulnerable to infection, with high prevalence rates observed in school-aged children. The impact on affected populations includes chronic morbidity, impaired growth and development, reduced productivity, and increased healthcare costs.

In conclusion, schistosomiasis is a global public health issue affecting millions of people, primarily in resource-limited settings. Its transmission is linked to poor sanitation, lack of clean water, and occupational exposure. The disease has a significant impact on affected regions and populations, with variations in prevalence rates and affected demographics. Efforts to control and eliminate schistosomiasis involve preventive measures, such as provision of clean water and sanitation, mass drug administration, snail control, and health education programs.

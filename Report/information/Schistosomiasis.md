Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. It is estimated that over 200 million people are currently infected worldwide, with the majority of cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Schistosomiasis is considered endemic in 78 countries, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions.

Schistosoma parasites have a complex life cycle involving freshwater snails as intermediate hosts and humans as definitive hosts. The primary mode of transmission occurs when individuals come into contact with water contaminated by feces or urine of infected individuals containing Schistosoma eggs. These eggs hatch in water and release larvae, called cercariae, which can penetrate the skin of people swimming, bathing, or working in contaminated water. Once inside the human body, the larvae develop into adult worms that reside in the blood vessels, particularly those surrounding the intestines or bladder, depending on the Schistosoma species.

Various factors contribute to the transmission of Schistosomiasis. Poor sanitation practices, lack of access to clean water, inadequate hygiene, and absence of proper waste management systems increase the risk of infection. Activities such as agriculture, fishing, and water-related recreational activities also contribute to exposure to contaminated water.

The impact of Schistosomiasis varies across different regions and populations. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most heavily affected region, accounting for approximately 90% of global cases. However, the disease is also endemic in parts of South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

Children are particularly vulnerable to Schistosomiasis due to their frequent contact with contaminated water during play, household chores, and agricultural activities. Chronic infections can lead to several health complications, including anemia, malnutrition, impaired cognitive development, and organ damage. Specifically, urogenital schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma haematobium, has been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer and reproductive tract abnormalities.

The historical context of Schistosomiasis dates back to ancient times, with evidence of infection found in Egyptian mummies from over 4,000 years ago. However, the discovery of the causative agents, Schistosoma parasites, was not made until the late 19th century by Theodor Bilharz, a German physician working in Egypt. Bilharz's findings laid the groundwork for understanding the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the disease.

Preventive strategies for Schistosomiasis primarily focus on mass drug administration with praziquantel, the recommended treatment for infected individuals. Improving sanitation facilities, providing a safe water supply, educating individuals on hygiene practices, and implementing snail control programs are also crucial for reducing transmission and reinfection rates. Integrated control programs, such as the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, have demonstrated significant success in reducing the burden of the disease in certain regions.

In conclusion, Schistosomiasis remains a significant global public health concern, with the highest burden observed in sub-Saharan Africa. Improving sanitation, ensuring access to safe water, and implementing comprehensive control strategies are essential for reducing the impact of Schistosomiasis, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children and those residing in endemic areas.

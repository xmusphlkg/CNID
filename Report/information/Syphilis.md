Syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, holds a significant place in human history as one of the oldest known diseases. Although the precise origin and emergence of syphilis remain subjects of debate, the disease gained significant recognition in Europe during the late 15th century following Christopher Columbus's voyage. It was commonly referred to as the "great pox" due to its devastating effects, which often resulted in disfigurement and death.

Prevalence:
Syphilis represents a global health concern, with approximately 6 million new cases reported annually. The prevalence of syphilis worldwide varies across regions, with higher rates observed in low- and middle-income countries. Based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO), sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas reported the highest rates of syphilis in 2016. Remarkably, syphilis has experienced a resurgence in many regions worldwide, even including developed countries.

Transmission Routes:
The primary mode of syphilis transmission is through sexual contact, encompassing vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Additionally, syphilis can be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during childbirth, known as congenital syphilis. In rare instances, syphilis can also be transmitted through blood transfusions, contaminated needles, or direct contact with open syphilis sores, known as chancres.

Affected Populations:
Syphilis can affect individuals of any age, gender, or sexual orientation. However, certain populations exhibit heightened vulnerability to infection. Key affected populations include men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers and their clients, individuals with multiple sexual partners, people living with HIV, and marginalized communities lacking access to adequate healthcare services.

Key Statistics:
- Global syphilis cases reached an estimated 1.3 million in 2018.
- The highest rates of syphilis are typically observed among young adults aged 15 to 49.
- Congenital syphilis, which can lead to severe birth defects or stillbirth, affects approximately 200,000 newborns each year.
- Some regions exhibit significantly higher syphilis prevalence rates among specific populations. For instance, in the United States, syphilis disproportionally affects African American and Hispanic populations.

Risk Factors:
Several risk factors contribute to syphilis transmission, including:
1. Unprotected sexual intercourse: Engaging in unprotected sex increases the risk of syphilis transmission.
2. Multiple sexual partners: Having multiple sexual partners enhances the likelihood of encountering someone infected with syphilis.
3. Unprotected oral sex: Syphilis can be transmitted through oral sex, making the use of condoms or dental dams during these encounters essential for risk reduction.
4. Substance abuse: Substance abuse, particularly the use of drugs impairing judgment, can lead to risky sexual behavior and elevate the chances of syphilis transmission.
5. Lack of access to healthcare: Limited access to healthcare facilities and insufficient screening and treatment services contribute to elevated rates of syphilis infection, particularly among marginalized communities.

Impact on Regions and Populations:
The impact of syphilis varies across regions and populations. In certain areas, syphilis represents a significant public health concern, with high prevalence rates resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. Complications stemming from syphilis, such as neurosyphilis (infection of the nervous system) or cardiovascular syphilis, can lead to long-term consequences.

While some regions have made notable progress in controlling syphilis by reducing transmission rates through effective prevention and treatment programs, other areas continue to face challenges due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure, limited resources, stigma, and low levels of awareness.

In conclusion, syphilis remains a global health threat. Its prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, and impact display considerable variability worldwide. Efforts to combat syphilis involve comprehensive sexual education, increased accessibility to healthcare, widespread testing, prompt treatment, and the promotion of safer sexual practices.
## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum. It progresses in stages and can last for years, affecting multiple organ systems. Initially presenting as sores, visible in the primary stage, it later manifests rashes and other symptoms in the secondary stage. If untreated, syphilis may advance to the latent and tertiary stages, resulting in severe complications, including neurological and cardiovascular complications. Transmission occurs primarily through sexual contact. Congenital syphilis is the infection of a newborn from an infected mother. It's preventable and treatable with the correct antibiotics.


## Highlights

1. There's an uptick in syphilis cases between April and August each year, peaking during summer; suggesting possible links with seasonal activities.<br/>
2. Despite fluctuations in cases, the number of syphilis-related deaths remained relatively low, indicating effective treatment options. <br/>
3. The year 2023 recorded a significant increase in cases, particularly high in August (61,068 cases), while the number of deaths has not escalated proportionately.<br/>
4. The September 2023 data showed a slight drop in cases (55,767), but above average compared to previous September data trends. The death rate remains fairly standard.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The cases of syphilis in mainland China demonstrate a somewhat fluctuating pattern over this thirteen-year period. Overall, there is a slight trend of increasing numbers from 2010 to 2023. They show a seasonal pattern, where cases tend to peak during July and show a dip in February. The highest number of cases were registered in August 2023 with 61068 cases, and the lowest in February 2020 with 21448 cases, which might be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic's precautions and health regulations.

### Deaths Analysis

The death toll for syphilis remained relatively low from 2010-2023, with deaths monthly often being in single-digit figures. No significant increase or trend can be seen throughout this timeframe. The highest number of deaths was recorded in January 2020 with 25 deaths relating to syphilis. It is notable that deaths typically do not align with peak case numbers, suggesting efficient syphilis treatments and health care responses. Reasonably consistent death numbers despite fluctuating case numbers may point towards robust health systems for syphilis treatment.

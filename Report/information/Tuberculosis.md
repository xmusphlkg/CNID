**Epidemiology of Tuberculosis:**

**Global Prevalence:**
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and the leading cause from a single infectious agent, ranking above HIV/AIDS. Despite the significant progress made over the past few decades, TB remains a prevalent infectious disease, especially in low- and middle-income countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), millions of people are diagnosed with TB each year, and in 2020, there were an estimated 10 million new TB cases worldwide.

**Transmission Routes:**
Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB primarily affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also affect other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB). The disease is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, sneeze, speak, or spit, expelling aerosol droplets that contain the bacteria. People nearby may then inhale these bacteria and become infected. Not everyone who becomes infected will become sick; latent TB infection (LTBI) occurs when a person has the bacteria but does not develop symptoms and is not contagious.

**Affected Populations and Key Statistics:**
The burden of TB is highest in Asia and Africa, with India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa accounting for two-thirds of new TB cases globally. TB affects all age groups and both sexes, although it is more common in men than women. Furthermore, TB rates are higher among people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, malnutrition, or diabetes, as well as among tobacco users and people who live or work in environments with poor infection control.

**Historical Context and Discovery:**
Tuberculosis has affected humanity for millennia, with evidence of the disease found in ancient human remains. TB was historically known as "consumption" because of the way it would consume individuals from within. The discovery of the TB bacterium is credited to Robert Koch, who announced the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1882, for which he received the Nobel Prize.

**Major Risk Factors:**
Major risk factors for TB transmission include:
- Close contact with someone who has active TB.
- Compromised immune system, notably due to HIV/AIDS.
- Living or traveling to areas with high TB prevalence.
- Living in crowded or unhygienic living conditions.
- Substance abuse, including alcoholism and intravenous drug use.
- Pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes or silicosis.
- Healthcare work that involves high risk of exposure to TB.

**Impact on Different Regions and Populations:**
The impact of TB varies widely across different regions and populations:
- **High Burden Countries (HBCs):** TB prevalence is highest in countries with constrained health resources. These countries often face challenges related to poverty, malnutrition, crowded living conditions, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure.
- **Children:** TB in children often goes undiagnosed and untreated due to non-specific symptoms and difficulties in obtaining sputum samples. Childhood TB is a significant concern in endemic regions.
- **HIV-Positive Individuals:** The risk of developing active TB is significantly higher in people living with HIV, and TB is a leading cause of death among these individuals.
- **Migrants and Refugees:** Displaced populations often come from or pass through high TB prevalence regions, and the stressors of migration can increase vulnerability to TB.
- **Marginalized Groups:** Homeless individuals, prisoners, and drug users are at higher risk due to factors like overcrowding, malnutrition, and weakened immune systems.

In conclusion, despite advancements in our understanding and treatment of TB, it remains a significant public health concern globally. Continuous efforts in public health measures, diagnostic improvements, accessible treatment, and prevention strategies, including vaccination, are crucial to control and eventually eliminate Tuberculosis as a public health threat.

Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are infectious diseases caused by the bacteria Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and Salmonella enterica serotypes Paratyphi A, B, and C, respectively. These diseases are significant public health concerns worldwide, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation and limited access to clean water. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever, including their global prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, key statistics, historical context, discovery, risk factors, and impact on different regions and populations.

Prevalence:
Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are prevalent globally, with the highest burden in low- and middle-income countries, especially in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), typhoid fever accounts for an estimated 11 to 21 million cases annually, resulting in approximately 128,000 to 161,000 deaths. Although paratyphoid fever is less common, it still contributes significantly to the overall burden of enteric fever cases.

Transmission Routes:
The primary mode of transmission for typhoid and paratyphoid fever is through contaminated food and water. This occurs when individuals ingest food or water contaminated with the feces or urine of infected individuals. It is also possible for people to become carriers of the bacteria, harboring it in their gallbladder and excreting it in their feces or urine for an extended period, even after recovering from the illness. Additionally, transmission can occur through direct contact with infected individuals or, less commonly, through contaminated objects, such as utensils or surfaces.

Affected Populations:
Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever can affect individuals of any age or gender. However, children and young adults are more susceptible to these diseases. Individuals living in areas with limited access to clean water, inadequate sanitation facilities, and overcrowded living conditions are at higher risk. Travelers visiting regions where these diseases are endemic are also susceptible, increasing the likelihood of contracting the illness and introducing it to non-endemic areas.

Key Statistics:
- Approximately 128,000 to 161,000 deaths occur annually due to typhoid fever.
- The overall case fatality rate for typhoid fever ranges from 2 to 4%, but it can be higher in resource-limited settings.
- The incidence rates of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers vary significantly across different regions, with some countries experiencing high endemic rates.
- Typhoid fever contributes to a substantial number of fever-related hospitalizations in endemic areas, resulting in economic burdens on individuals and healthcare systems.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Typhoid fever has been documented throughout history, with outbreaks often associated with poor sanitation and crowded living conditions. The link between contaminated water and the transmission of typhoid fever became evident in the 19th century. In 1880, German bacteriologist Carl Joseph Eberth identified the Bacillus typhosus, now known as Salmonella Typhi, as the causative agent of typhoid fever. Likewise, paratyphoid fever was identified in the early 20th century, with the differentiation of various serotypes.

Risk Factors:
- Limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities.
- Poor hygiene practices, particularly inadequate handwashing.
- Living in overcrowded areas, such as slums or refugee camps.
- Consumption of contaminated food or water, including street food or improperly stored food.
- Traveling to or residing in regions with a high prevalence of typhoid and paratyphoid fever.
- Lack of vaccination or incomplete vaccination coverage.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever have a significant impact on regions with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. In countries where these diseases are endemic, they contribute to a substantial burden of illness, resulting in morbidity, mortality, and economic costs. Outbreaks can have devastating effects, especially on vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and malnourished individuals. The impact is often compounded by factors such as inadequate healthcare infrastructure and limited diagnostic and treatment capabilities.

In conclusion, typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are globally prevalent infectious diseases that have significant impacts on affected populations. Understanding their epidemiology, including global prevalence, transmission routes, affected populations, risk factors, and impact on different regions, is crucial for implementing effective prevention and control strategies. These strategies include improved sanitation, access to clean water, vaccination programs, and public health interventions.
## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are systemic illnesses caused by Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, respectively. Characterized by high fever, weakness, stomach pain, and in some cases, rash, they are commonly contracted via contaminated food or water. While typhoid is more severe, both diseases are endemic in regions with poor sanitation, and can spread rapidly without fundamental public health measures. Vaccination and antibiotics help manage these diseases, but emerging antibiotic resistance necessitates continuous monitoring and research.

## Highlights

1. There is a consistent seasonal trend, with a rise in cases from March to August followed by a fall that reaches lowest in February. This suggests environmental factors significantly influence disease transmission.<br/>
2. The number of cases and deaths have generally decreased over the years, indicating successful interventions or progress in public health measures. The zero deaths in September 2023 suggest a particular triumph in managing severe cases.<br/>
3. Despite the overall decline, spikes in cases still occur (eg. July 2013), implying persistent risk factors or occasional failures in preventive measures.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reveals a consistent seasonal pattern of typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases in mainland China, with most cases reported during the summer months—peaking usually in July or August—and fewer cases reported during the cooler months. The data also shows a gradual decrease in cases in recent years. For instance, July had 1799 cases in 2013, but this fell to 657 cases by 2023. The overall trend indicates that China has made substantial progress in controlling these diseases.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of reported deaths due to typhoid or paratyphoid fever is significantly lower than cases throughout the years, suggesting a low case fatality rate. Deaths are relatively infrequent and sporadic with no clear seasonal or yearly pattern. Notably, June 2017 reports a peak of 3 deaths, the highest in the given period. Although the number of cases is decreasing overall, the number of deaths does not strictly follow this trend indicating the continued need for effective treatment strategies.

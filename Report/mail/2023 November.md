Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC Weekly has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2023 November.

Given the provided data and the structure of the analysis you have requested, here is an interpretation and key points for select diseases based on the November 2023 cases and deaths reported in mainland China:

**1. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS):** In November 2023, there were 7897 reported cases of AIDS with 2444 deaths. This high number of all-cause deaths among reported AIDS patients indicates ongoing challenges in managing the disease and its complications.

**2. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis:** There were 2958 cases reported and no deaths. This suggests that the disease is relatively well-controlled in terms of mortality but still has a notable prevalence.

**3. Anthrax:** With 25 cases and no deaths reported, anthrax appears to be rare and effectively managed, as reflected by the absence of mortality in the data for November.

**4. Brucellosis:** November saw 2557 cases and 1 death due to brucellosis. These figures suggest a relatively low fatality rate, but the disease's impact on public health persist due to its caseload.

**5. Cholera:** No cases or deaths were reported in November 2023, indicating successful control or elimination of cholera in Mainland China during that period.

**6. Dengue:** Reporting 184 cases and 1 death, dengue continues to pose a risk, though the fatality rate remains low likely due to effective clinical management.

**7. Dysentery:** There were 4523 cases of dysentery with no deaths. Despite the absence of fatalities, dysentery remains a concern due to its potential for outbreaks and high transmission rates.

**8. Epidemic hemorrhagic fever:** With 1700 cases and 17 deaths, this disease shows a mortality rate that will require continued surveillance and response strategies.

**9. Hand, foot, and mouth disease:** As a common disease in children, the report of 153086 cases and 1 death suggests that while the disease is widespread, it is generally not fatal.

**10. Hepatitis B:** November brought 96336 cases and 40 deaths due to Hepatitis B, suggesting a sizeable burden of chronic liver disease and its complications needing ongoing public health attention.

**11. Infectious diarrhea (excluding other gastrointestinal diseases):** 108329 cases were reported with 2 deaths. Although low in mortality, infectious diarrhea's high incidence signifies a public health priority for hygiene and sanitation practices.

**12. Influenza:** There were 130442 cases and 13 deaths due to influenza, emphasizing the need for vaccination and public health measures during flu season.

**13. Malaria:** With 181 cases and 1 death, malaria's presence indicates the need for continued vector control and access to effective antimalarial treatments.

**14. Measles:** With 185 cases and no deaths, measles immunization programs appear effective in preventing fatal outcomes, though the case count requires vigilance to prevent outbreaks.

**15. Tuberculosis (TB):** There were 83205 cases and 214 deaths reported. TB remains a significant health concern, with mortality figures highlighting the need for robust detection, treatment, and prevention programs.

**16. Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever:** This group noted 685 cases and 1 death. Control measures including food safety, clean water, and vaccination in risk areas remain important.

**17. Human infection with H7N9 virus:** Despite no cases or deaths reported in November 2023, ongoing monitoring of avian influenza viruses is crucial due to their pandemic potential.

**18. Rabies:** It continues to be fatal if not promptly treated, as evidenced by the 34 cases resulting in 46 deaths, suggesting potential issues with access to post-exposure prophylaxis.

It is important to note that these observations are based only on the reported data without additional context regarding public health interventions, changes in diagnostic criteria, or reporting practices. Additionally, these numbers are without annual verification and may not reflect duplicates or corrections that occur in February of the following year. Finally, COVID-19 data is excluded from this evaluation.

Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC Weekly has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in mainland China in 2023 November.

Based on the provided data for November 2023 in mainland China, here are the key points for selected diseases:

**1. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS):** Reported as having 7366 new cases with 2245 deaths. It's worth noting that the deaths are all-cause deaths reported in the month by cumulative reported AIDS patients.

**2. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis:** There were 3206 new cases, but no deaths were reported. Itâ€™s a highly contagious eye infection but typically self-limited with rare severe complications.

**3. Anthrax:** Saw 22 new cases with no reported deaths. Anthrax is a serious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis but is generally rare in humans.

**4. Brucellosis:** Showed 2892 cases with zero deaths, indicating an incidence of the bacterial disease without lethal outcomes in the reported period.

**5. Cholera:** No cases or deaths reported, which suggests effective control or low circulation of Vibrio cholerae in the population.

**6. Dengue:** There were 1767 cases with 1 reported death. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease and can sometimes be fatal due to complications like dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.

**7. Dysentery:** 4680 cases were reported without any associated deaths. Dysentery is typically a bacterial or amoebic infection leading to severe diarrhea.

**8. Hepatitis (all types included):** Hepatitis remains a public health issue with Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E collectively contributing to a significant number of cases - 2062 reported for Hepatitis A and 102174 cases reported for Hepatitis B. These viral liver diseases can lead to chronic conditions and severe outcomes.

**9. Human infection with H7N9 virus:** No cases or deaths reported, suggesting no current transmission or effective measures against this particular strain of avian influenza.

**10. Tuberculosis (TB):** Reported 73000 cases and 177 deaths. TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and continues to be a leading infectious cause of mortality.

**11. Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever:** With 642 reported cases and no deaths, these enteric fevers caused by Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi indicate continued presence but non-lethal impacts in the reported month.

**12. Infectious diarrhea (excluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever):** A significant number of 89252 cases were reported with 3 associated deaths, indicating the prevalence of various diarrheal diseases other than the excluded ones.

**13. Influenza:** Reported cases of 156205 with 5 deaths, reinforcing it as a common respiratory infection with potential for severe outcomes especially among high-risk groups.

**14. Hand, foot, and mouth disease:** Showed high incidence rates with 100161 cases and no reported deaths, typical of this viral illness affecting children which is usually non-lethal but highly contagious.

Please note that these data points are based on reported cases and deaths within the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System in China and exclude data from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. The numbers can be subject to change upon annual verification.

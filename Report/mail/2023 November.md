Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC Weekly has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in mainland China in 2023 November.

**1. Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis:** Recorded 2958 cases without any deaths, indicating a high transmissibility but low mortality for this disease in November 2023.

**2. Brucellosis:** With 2557 reported cases and 1 death, Brucellosis continues to be a concern, possibly due to occupational exposure in agricultural sectors.

**3. Dengue:** A total of 184 cases and 1 death reported, suggesting localized outbreaks and effective clinical management to prevent higher mortality rates.

**4. Dysentery:** This bacterial infection had 4523 cases with no deaths reported, showing that it may have been effectively controlled and treated.

**5. Echinococcosis:** 538 cases have been recorded. This disease, caused by tapeworm larvae, persists, possibly in rural or areas with poor sanitation.

**6. Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever:** A notifiable disease with 1700 cases and 17 deaths, indicating a need for continued surveillance and public health interventions.

**7. Gonorrhea:** Shows high infectivity with 10999 cases reported but no deaths, consistent with this sexually transmitted infection's nature.

**8. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease:** Extremely high case number at 153086 but only 1 death, which reflects its common occurrence among children with typically mild symptoms.

**9. Hepatitis B:** Notably high at 96336 cases, with 40 deaths, pointing to a significant public health issue, given the disease's potential for chronic liver complications.

**10. Infectious Diarrhea:** Very high incidence with 108329 cases but low mortality with only 2 deaths. Good clinical treatment is likely in place to address common causative agents like norovirus and rotavirus.

**11. Influenza:** With 130442 cases and 13 deaths, influenza remains a common respiratory disease with seasonal peaks.

**12. Measles:** Relatively low at 185 cases and no deaths, which could imply high vaccination coverage.

**13. Meningococcal Meningitis:** A rare but severe disease, with just 14 cases and no deaths, possibly due to effective vaccination programs and prompt treatment.

**14. Mumps:** High incidence with 26717 cases, no associated deaths, often affecting children and young adults, indicating potential fluctuations in the coverage or efficacy of vaccination.

**15. Neonatal Tetanus:** Life-threatening in newborns, with a low case number of 11 but a high mortality rate with 1 death, likely due to unhygienic birthing practices in certain areas.

**16. Tuberculosis:** With 83205 cases and a significant number of deaths at 214, it remains a major public health concern that requires ongoing control strategies and treatment adherence.

**17. Typhoid Fever and Paratyphoid Fever:** A concerning figure of 685 cases and 1 death suggests exposure to contaminated food and water in certain regions.

**18. Human Infection with H7N9 Virus:** One case with one resultant death, indicating a potentially high case-fatality rate for this particular strain of avian influenza.

It's essential to interpret this data with caution, as these are preliminary reports not accounting for annual verification, which could affect final case totals. Furthermore, these numbers do not consider factors such as population density, healthcare access, and regional variations in disease surveillance. The list serves as an indicator of disease trends within China for the reported period and would be a significant component of public health planning and response.

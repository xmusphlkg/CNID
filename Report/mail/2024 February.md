Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2024 February.

In analyzing the monthly cases and deaths related to various diseases on the Chinese mainland for February 2024, we focus on the diseases with the highest number of cases and notable death counts. Here is the structured list:

**1. Influenza:** February 2024 recorded a high incidence with 986,543 cases and 108 deaths. This respiratory infection shows significant seasonal activity.  
**2. Hand, foot and mouth disease:** A common viral illness especially in children, reported 131,798 cases but relatively low mortality with only 1 death.  
**3. Infectious diarrhea (excluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever):** Reported a substantial number of cases totaling 108,084, with a low death count of 1, indicating effective management of severe cases.  
**4. Hepatitis (All types):** Total cases are 124,433 with Hepatitis B dominating in terms of case count at 100,209 and related deaths at 52. Combined hepatitis cases led to 64 deaths. Effective vaccination can control the spread.  
**5. Tuberculosis:** Continues to be a concern with 76,331 cases and a notable 304 deaths, underscoring the need for robust TB control measures.  
**6. Syphilis:** Reported 76,360 cases, relatively high for sexually transmitted diseases, but with lower mortality at just 383 deaths. This suggests effective treatment options are available.  
**7. Gonorrhea:** Notably high case count at 92,734, but no deaths reported, reflecting successful management of the infection.  
**8. Dengue:** Observed a surge with 9,381 cases and 2 deaths, highlighting the need for vector control and public awareness programs.  
**9. Japanese encephalitis:** Low case number at 10, but high mortality rate with 9 deaths, indicating a severe risk of death upon infection.  
**10. Mumps:** Relatively high case count at 27,704 cases but no deaths, typically affecting children and young adults.  
**11. Rubella:** 26,864 cases reported with a single death, emphasizing the importance of immunization.  
**12. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS):** 5,357 cases of HIV/AIDS reported with 1,849 all-cause deaths in reported AIDS patients suggests ongoing challenges in managing long-term health outcomes.

It's important to consider that these numbers could change after annual verification, which is conducted for de-duplication and verification of reported cases. Additionally, the list only includes diseases with significant case counts or death tolls for brevity and focuses on diseases that are of current public health importance or indicative of seasonal patterns. Measures such as vaccination, hygiene promotion, vector control, and sexual health education play crucial roles in controlling these diseases.

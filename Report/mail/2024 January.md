I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2024 January.

**1. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** January saw 6277 cases and 1658 deaths. This significant number of all-cause deaths among reported AIDS patients highlights the ongoing challenge of managing this chronic condition.

**2. Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis:** In January, there were 3407 cases reported but no deaths. This high case number with no fatalities suggests effective management of this contagious eye infection.

**3. Anthrax:** A relatively rare disease with only 14 cases and no deaths reported in January. This low incidence indicates effective control measures.

**4. Brucellosis:** There were 4559 cases reported without any fatalities. The absence of deaths could indicate effective treatment and control methods for this bacterial infection.

**5. Cholera:** No cases or deaths were reported in January, suggesting successful prevention and control measures for this potentially severe gastrointestinal disease.

**6. Dengue:** Reported 142 cases with no deaths. This low fatality rate might indicate effective medical care and disease management.

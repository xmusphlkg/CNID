**1. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS):**
   - 7897 reported cases of which 2444 resulted in deaths.
   - The number of deaths represents the all-cause deaths reported by cumulative reported AIDS patients within the month.

   - 2958 reported cases with no reported deaths.
   - This disease shows significant incidence but is not associated with mortality in the reported period.

**3. Anthrax:**
   - 25 reported cases with no reported deaths.
   - Anthrax shows lower incidence and no mortality in this period, indicative of potential effective control measures or low endemic presence.

   - The disease continues to pose a health threat but with a low mortality rate.

**5. Dengue:**
   - 184 reported cases with 1 death.
   - Dengue presence is relatively low compared to some other infectious diseases, yet there is a recorded fatality.

**6. Echinococcosis:**

   - This parasitic disease exhibits moderate prevalence with no deaths in the reported month.

**7. Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF):**

   - EHF maintains a concerning mortality rate among the reported cases.

**8. Gonorrhea:**
   - 10999 reported cases with no deaths.
   - High incidence of this sexually transmitted infection, which doesn't directly lead to mortality in the reported timeframe.

**9. Hepatitis B:**

   - Hepatitis B shows a high number of cases compared to other forms of hepatitis, with associated mortality.

**10. Hepatitis C:**

   - Noticeable cases of Hepatitis C, lower than Hepatitis B but with reported fatalities.

**11. Human Infection with H7N9 Virus:**
   - 1 reported case which also resulted in death.
   - Although just one case was reported, it resulted in a fatality, showcasing the high mortality rate of this particular infection.

**12. Infectious Diarrhea(¶):**
   - 108329 reported cases with 2 deaths.
   - A significant number of cases reported with a very low death ratio, suggesting it is mostly non-lethal in nature.

**13. Influenza:**
   - 130442 reported cases with 13 deaths.
   - A high incidence of influenza cases with a relatively small proportion of fatalities.

**14. Malaria:**
   - 181 reported cases with 1 death.
   - Low incidence and low mortality from this mosquito-borne disease, potentially due to effective preventive measures.

**15. Measles:**
   - 185 reported cases with no deaths.
   - Presence of measles is moderate, without any mortality in the reported period.

**16. Mumps:**
   - 26717 reported cases with no deaths.

   - TB remains a significant infectious disease in terms of both incidence and associated mortality.

**18. Typhoid Fever and Paratyphoid Fever:**
   - 685 reported cases with 1 death.
   - Report shows a moderate number of cases with relatively low mortality for these enteric fevers.

Please note that these numbers are subject to change after annual verification which usually happens in February. It is also worth mentioning that monkeypox has been included in the management of Class B infectious diseases since September 20, 2023, as noted in the footnote; however, no data was provided for this report. Additionally, COVID-19 data is not included in this summary.

Remember, the data shows both the occurrence and deaths without necessarily indicating causation – for instance, reported deaths in AIDS patients do not imply HIV/AIDS as the cause of death; they reflect all-cause mortality among the reported patients. It is also important to note that due to the nature of this data, numbers from different diseases cannot be directly compared in terms of severity without considering the wider epidemiological context, such as transmission modes, prevention measures, and healthcare system response.

Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC Weekly has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2023 November.

Based on the vast amount of data provided, I will list key points for a selection of the notable diseases from November 2023 in the Chinese mainland, considering the sheer volume of information. For the full analysis of every disease listed, a structured research approach and access to the full data set would be required.

Please note, COVID-19 is not included as specified. Here are the key points for select diseases:

**1. HIV/AIDS:** Reported cases in November are notable due to the high number of all-cause deaths among cumulative reported AIDS patients, which is significant (7897 cases with 2444 deaths). This suggests ongoing transmission and potentially late diagnoses leading to high mortality.

**2. Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis:** With 2958 cases reported and no deaths, this disease seems to be widespread but not fatal. The high incidence could be related to its highly contagious nature.

**3. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease:** Extremely high number of cases reported (153,086), but with a very low death count (1), indicating that while the disease is highly prevalent, it is not often fatal.

**4. Hepatitis B:** Another disease with a high number of cases (96,336) that leads to a considerable number of deaths (40), highlighting it as a significant public health concern.

**5. Tuberculosis:** Continues to be a major issue with a high number of cases (83,205) and considerable deaths (214). This indicates ongoing transmission and the seriousness of the disease.

**6. Infectious Diarrhea (Excludes cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever):** Extremely high incidence reported (108,329), but with low mortality (2), which might reflect effective treatment options or infections of a less severe nature.

**7. Mumps:** A total of 26,717 cases with no deaths suggests a well-contained disease possibly due to effective vaccination strategies, although incidence is still high.

**8. Cholera, Diphtheria, Neonatal Tetanus, Plague, Poliomyelitis, Rabies, SARS-CoV:** All report zero cases and zero deaths, which is a strong indicator of effective disease control and possible eradication efforts.

**9. Monkeypox:** As a newer addition to Class B infectious diseases, there is no data (NaN), which potentially means there were no cases, or the data was not reported in this format.

**10. Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever:** With 1,700 cases leading to 17 deaths, this disease maintains a presence and requires ongoing surveillance and response.

**11. Japanese Encephalitis:** The number of cases is relatively low (24), but with a high fatality rate (9 deaths), it marks this disease as being of critical concern, given its high case-fatality ratio.

**12. Schistosomiasis:** Even with a lower incidence (266 cases), this disease caused 4 deaths, which calls for targeted intervention measures.

The information presented here relies on the accuracy and completeness of the provided data. Such analyses are crucial for public health officials to prioritize healthcare resources, plan for vaccine distributions, and develop targeted intervention programmes.

# Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns:

The data provided indicates a distinct seasonal pattern for cases of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) in mainland China. The number of cases is highest during the summer months (June, July, and August) and lowest during the winter months (December, January, and February). This suggests that AHC is more prevalent in the warmer months.

Peak and Trough Periods:

In mainland China, the peak period for AHC cases occurs in August, with a peak value of 12,742 cases reported in August 2023. Conversely, the trough period occurs in December, with the lowest number of cases reported (2,390 cases in December 2014).

Overall Trends:

Overall, there is an increasing trend in the number of AHC cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. The number of cases started relatively low in 2010, with 634 cases reported in January, and gradually increased over the years, reaching a peak of 125,264 cases in September 2023. However, it is important to note that there is a significant spike in cases in July and August 2023, which may be an outlier or a result of specific circumstances.

Discussion:

The observed seasonal pattern of AHC cases in mainland China aligns with previous studies and reports on the disease. AHC is known to be more common in tropical and subtropical regions, and the higher temperatures and humidity during the summer months may contribute to increased transmission of the virus causing AHC.

The peak period in August coincides with the peak of the summer season when people are more likely to engage in outdoor activities and have increased contact with others, potentially facilitating the spread of the disease. The trough period in December corresponds to the colder winter months when people tend to spend more time indoors and have less contact with others, leading to a decrease in AHC transmission.

The overall increasing trend in AHC cases over the years may be attributed to various factors, including improved surveillance and reporting systems, increased awareness and testing for AHC, and changes in population dynamics and behavior. It is also important to consider that the spike in cases in July and August 2023 may be influenced by specific events or outbreaks that occurred during that period.

Further analysis and investigation are necessary to understand the specific factors contributing to the observed seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends in AHC cases in mainland China. This information can help inform public health interventions and strategies to control and prevent the spread of AHC in the future.
## Introduction

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious, viral infection of the conjunctiva characterized by sudden onset of painful, swollen, red eyes, with subconjunctival hemorrhages, and excessive tearing. The condition may also involve blurry vision, sensitivity to light, and the sensation of a foreign body in the eye. Enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24 variant are the primary causative agents. It can affect individuals of all ages and spreads rapidly through direct contact with ocular secretions or contaminated surfaces. Outbreaks are more common in tropical and subtropical regions. There is no specific treatment; management focuses on symptomatic relief.

## Highlights

- A dramatic spike in acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases occurred in September 2023, with 125,264 reported cases, representing a stark increase from previous months and the highest monthly case count in the dataset. <br/>
- Despite the significant rise in cases, there have been no reported deaths associated with the disease in October 2023, continuing a trend of low mortality throughout the observed period. <br/>
- The cases in October 2023 show a decrease to 23,111, suggesting that the peak of the outbreak may have passed or that control measures are taking effect. <br/>
- Historical data indicate that the disease exhibits seasonality with peaks during the summer months, but the surge in 2023 surpasses seasonal trends and warrants investigations into potential new viral strains or changes in transmission patterns. <br/>

Between January 2010 and October 2023, mainland China reported an increasing trend in acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases with seasonal peaks, particularly during late summer and early autumn. The most notable surge occurred in September 2023, with a record 125,264 cases, indicating a significant outbreak. The data shows sporadic fluctuations, but the overall trajectory suggests heightened transmission during warmer months. Prior to the 2023 escalation, there were occasional spikes, including significant increases in September of 2010 and 2014.

Throughout the thirteen-year span, deaths remained exceptionally rare, with only three fatalities reported among tens of thousands of cases, emphasizing the typically non-lethal nature of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. The mortalities were recorded in December 2011, August 2019, and February 2020. Despite the substantial outbreak in case numbers observed in 2023, no deaths were reported. This pattern reflects the disease's relatively low mortality risk despite its capacity for rapid and extensive spread within a population.

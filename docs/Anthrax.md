# Anthrax 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the data provided, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in the number of Anthrax cases in mainland China. Generally, the number of cases is higher during the summer months (June to August) and lower during the winter months (December to February). This pattern is consistent across multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
Typically, there is a peak period for Anthrax cases in mainland China in August, with a high number of cases reported. Conversely, a trough period is observed in January, with a lower number of cases reported.

Overall Trends: 
From 2010 to 2023, there is a slight increasing trend in the number of Anthrax cases in mainland China. Although the number of cases fluctuates from year to year, there is a general upward trend over the years.

Discussion: 
The presence of a seasonal pattern in the data suggests that certain environmental factors or conditions during the summer months may contribute to the higher incidence of Anthrax cases. Warmer temperatures and increased outdoor activities during this time of year could potentially increase the risk of exposure to the bacteria causing Anthrax.

The peak in August may also be influenced by other factors such as agricultural practices or livestock management, as Anthrax is known to affect animals as well. Further investigation into these specific factors contributing to the seasonal pattern and peak in August is necessary to fully understand the dynamics of Anthrax transmission in mainland China.

The overall increasing trend in the number of cases over the years could be attributed to various factors, including improved surveillance and reporting systems, increased awareness and testing for Anthrax, changes in livestock management practices, or changes in environmental conditions. However, without additional data and analysis, it is challenging to determine the exact reasons for this trend.

It is important to note that the analysis is based on the provided data, and any conclusions should be interpreted with caution. Further research and analysis, including the consideration of additional factors such as geographical variations and specific risk factors, is necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of Anthrax in mainland China.
## Introduction

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It primarily affects livestock and wild game, but can also infect humans when they are exposed to the bacteria through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products, inhalation of spores, or ingestion. In humans, anthrax presents in various forms: cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal, and injectional, each with different symptoms. This disease is not contagious person-to-person. Effective vaccines and antibiotics are available for treatment and prevention. If left untreated, anthrax can be fatal.

## Highlights

- Seasonal spikes during the warmer months: Notably, cases seem to peak annually during the summer months, especially from July to August, suggesting a seasonal pattern possibly related to climatic conditions and human activities. <br/>
- Moderate increase in cases over the years: Although fluctuations are present, there is a general trend of increasing anthrax cases, with a significant jump observed in August 2023 (123 cases), indicating a need for preventive measures. <br/>
- Low mortality rate: The data reflects a relatively low mortality rate across the years, with few deaths reported even when case numbers are high, which could be attributed to effective medical interventions. <br/>
- The current disease situation as of October 2023: With 47 cases and no deaths reported, the situation seems to be under control, but continuous surveillance and preventive strategies are imperative to avert spikes like that seen in August. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The anthrax case data from mainland China between January 2010 and October 2023 shows seasonal variation with a higher incidence in the summer months, especially from June to August. The year 2018 had the highest reported cases with 103 in August, suggesting possible outbreaks. Over the years, there is a slight increasing trend in case numbers, indicating either improved surveillance and reporting, or environmental factors contributing to more frequent transmission from animal to human hosts, pointing to potential occupational or agricultural exposure risks that require ongoing monitoring and intervention.

### Deaths Analysis
The death count from anthrax from 2010 to 2023 indicates low fatality rates with 0 to 4 deaths reported per occurrence, the higher mortality observed in September 2012. Despite an upward trend in cases in some years, deaths have remained relatively stable. This stability suggests effective clinical interventions and timely treatment for infected individuals. Seasonal spikes in mortality align with higher case reports, underscoring the importance of heightened vigilance and rapid response during peak transmission periods. Continued efforts in prevention, early detection, and treatment are essential to maintain or reduce these mortality rates.

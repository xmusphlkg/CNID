# Anthrax 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Anthrax is an intense infectious disease instigated by the spore-forming bacteria Bacillus anthracis. It primarily affects domestic and wild animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Humans typically contract the disease by exposure to infected animals or their products. Anthrax can manifest in three forms: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or inhalation, characterized by symptoms ranging from skin sores to severe breathing difficulty and shock. Although it's a severe disease, it's rare and can be effectively treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early.
## Highlights

- Seasonal pattern observed with cases peaking during the summer months, particularly in August, alongside a few exceptions with escalated case numbers during colder months, suggesting periodic outbreaks or increased transmission risks in certain years. <br/>
- The highest number of cases within the observed period was recorded in August 2023, with 123 cases, yet resulted in no deaths, indicating possible improvements in medical interventions or disease management. <br/>
- Mortality associated with Anthrax is sporadic with no consistent trend in fatality rates, although some spikes in deaths were recorded (e.g., September 2012 with 4 deaths, indicating variable virulence or case management effectiveness over time. <br/>
- Overall, the situation in November 2023 reflects a mid-range incidence with 36 cases and no fatalities, suggesting a controlled scenario but necessitating continued surveillance and preventive measures. <br/>

Anthrax cases in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 show annual seasonality, with spikes typically in warmer months, especially August. The highest number of monthly cases occurred in August 2023 (123 cases), indicating a potential worsening of outbreaks over time. The data suggests the presence of environmental or occupational risk factors that may be more pronounced during these months. It is possible that agricultural practices linked to the handling of livestock might contribute to these peaks, necessitating focused preventative measures during this period.

The mortality data associated with anthrax cases from 2010 to 2023 suggest a low fatality rate, with most months recording zero deaths. However, sporadic occurrences of deaths, such as in September 2012, July 2017, and August 2022, point to occasional increased severity or delays in treatment. The highest number of deaths in a single month was four in September 2012. The majority of deaths occur in months with the highest number of cases, underlining the need for heightened awareness and rapid response capabilities during peak transmission times.

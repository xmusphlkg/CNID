# Anthrax 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Anthrax is a serious, life-threatening, infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Found naturally in soil, these bacteria primarily affect livestock and wild game. Humans get infected through exposure to infected animals or their products. The disease manifests in three forms: cutaneous (skin), inhalation (lungs), and gastrointestinal (digestive system). Its symptoms vary depending on the type contracted and can range from skin sores to severe breathing problems, or stomach symptoms. Anthrax is not contagious and can be prevented or treated with antibiotics if detected early.

## Highlights

- There is a clear annual cycle for anthrax cases, with the number of cases peaking during the summer months (July and August), possibly related to agricultural activities. It has been consistent throughout the years.<br/>
- The number of anthrax cases has been relatively stable over the years, however, the spikes seen in the summer months have been increasing particularly noted in August 2023 with 123 cases.<br/>
- Mortality due to anthrax is generally low, sporadic and does not follow a pattern. Although there are some sporadic spikes, it doesn't correlate with the increase in cases.<br/>
- As of November 2023, the situation is under control with 36 reported cases and no deaths, but vigilance is necessary given the usual rise in the summer.

The reported data suggest a clear seasonal pattern in Anthrax cases from 2010 to 2023 in mainland China, peaking between July and August each year. This trend may correlate with agricultural practices or weather conditions conducive to Anthrax spores' activity. A significant upsurge can be observed from 2016 onwards, with the largest outbreak occurring in August 2023 with 123 cases. However, it's evident that despite annual fluctuations, there is no sharp increase in overall cases across the years, suggesting improved diagnostic and preventive measures may be in place.

Overall, the number of deaths due to Anthrax across the given period is low, further pointing towards effective clinical management of cases in China. Notably, the months of July, August, and September witness slightly more deaths corresponding to the peak seasons of Anthrax cases, hinting at a probable correlation. There appears to be a rough biennial pattern of slightly higher deaths, occurring in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016, which wanes afterwards. Fortunately, the highest number of deaths in a single month (4) was reported only once in September 2012, indicating a generally low fatality rate.

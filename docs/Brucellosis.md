# Brucellosis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Brucellosis is a bacteria-caused infectious disease that may be contracted from animals like goats, cattle, sheep, or dogs. It is transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or by consuming contaminated food products. Humans may display symptoms such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, and joint, muscle, or back pain. Severe complications can involve multiple organ systems. Although Brucellosis can be serious, it is treatable with antibiotics. Public health measures include food safety and occupational precautions for those in contact with susceptible animals.


## Highlights

1. Overall Increase in Cases: The provided data for the period 2010-2023 shows that there has been a consistent increase in the number of Brucellosis cases in mainland China, but a relatively stable and low incidence of deaths connected to the disease. <br/>
2. Mortality Rate: Despite the gradual increase, the Brucellosis mortality rate remained quite low throughout the considered period. <br/>
3. Seasonal Variation: The data also suggests a noticeable seasonal pattern, with the incidence peaking during the summer months and dropping during the autumn and winter months. <br/>
4. Recent Status: As of November 2023, there were 4540 reported cases of Brucellosis and no deaths, tracking slightly above levels earlier in the decade.

From 2010 to 2023, the data presents a recurrent annual pattern for Brucellosis cases in mainland China. Cases often surge in mid-year, typically peaking between May and August. Over the years, a slight but ascending trend is evident, with the total annual cases gradually rising. The highest reported case occurred in June 2022, with 9943 cases. It's worth noting that in general, the first quarter sees a lower number of cases, which then progressively rise, demonstrating a possible seasonal pattern to Brucellosis outbreaks.

The total number of deaths from Brucellosis from 2010 to 2023 remained extremely low compared to the number of cases, indicating a low case fatality rate. A yearly maximum of 2 deaths occurred in July 2018, July 2021, and September 2023, which may suggest more severe outcomes in the peak case period possibly due to healthcare system stress. However, there isn't a clear trend in the data regarding fatalities, which remain sporadic month-to-month and year-to-year. In general, Brucellosis, while infective, appears to cause few deaths based on this data.

# Brucellosis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by various Brucella species, which primarily infect cattle, swine, goats, sheep, and dogs. Humans contract the disease when they come in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacteria. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, sweating, headache, and muscle/joint pain. The disease can become chronic and might affect various organs. It can be treated effectively with a specific regime of antibiotics. Preventative measures include vaccination of livestock and avoiding unpasteurized dairy products.
## Highlights

- Steadily rising Brucellosis cases in China since 2010, with seasonal spikes occurring between May and July each year. <br/>
- Occasional fatalities recorded, underscoring the disease's persistent public health impact despite low mortality rates. <br/>
- The year 2023 continues to show high case numbers, peaking during the summer months, with 9164 cases in July and 2 deaths in September. <br/>
- As of November 2023, cases slightly decreased to 4540 with no reported deaths, suggesting a possible decline as winter approaches. <br/>

Throughout the reported time frame, Brucellosis-associated deaths in the Chinese mainland are rare, totaling 22 deaths from December 2010 to September 2023. The data suggests that while Brucellosis is a widespread zoonotic disease with increasing incidence, it maintains a low mortality rate. Deaths are sporadic and do not follow a distinct seasonal pattern or yearly trend. The highest number of deaths in a single month is two, observed thrice—in July 2018, September 2023, and September 2021—suggesting no significant changes in the lethality of the disease.

# Brucellosis 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns:

The data suggests the presence of a seasonal pattern in the incidence of Brucellosis cases in mainland China. The number of cases tends to be higher between March and July, with a peak occurring in June. Conversely, the number of cases generally decreases from August to February, reaching a lowest point in January. This seasonal pattern is observed consistently throughout the years, indicating a recurring variation in Brucellosis cases.

Peak and Trough Periods:

The highest number of Brucellosis cases in mainland China is typically reported in June, constituting the peak period. Conversely, the lowest number of cases is observed in January, constituting the trough period. The occurrence of these peak and trough periods remains consistent throughout the years analyzed.

Overall Trends:

From 2010 to 2023, there is an overall upward trend in the number of Brucellosis cases in mainland China. Although there are fluctuations from year to year, the general trajectory displays an increase. It should be noted, however, that the data for 2023 only covers until October, and thus the trend for the entire year remains incomplete.

Discussion:

The observed seasonal patterns in Brucellosis cases in mainland China suggest the potential influence of environmental or climatic factors on disease transmission. The rise in cases between March and July may be influenced by increased human contact with infected animals or consumption of contaminated food products during this period. Conversely, the decrease in cases from August to February may be attributed to factors such as reduced outdoor activities, changes in livestock management practices, or improved public health measures.

The overall upward trend in Brucellosis cases over the years emphasizes the ongoing necessity for surveillance and control measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Efforts should center on identifying and addressing risk factors associated with Brucellosis transmission, including improving animal husbandry practices, promoting food safety measures, and raising awareness among healthcare professionals and the general public.

It is worth noting that the analysis presented solely relies on the provided data regarding Brucellosis cases in mainland China. Conducting further analysis and considering additional factors, such as population demographics, geographical variations, and implemented control measures, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease trends and patterns.
## Introduction

Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacterial genus Brucella, which is transmitted from animals to humans. It commonly affects cattle, swine, goats, sheep, and dogs. Humans typically acquire the disease through direct contact with infected animals or by consuming contaminated animal products, especially unpasteurized milk and cheese. Characterized by fever, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint swelling, brucellosis can become chronic and may affect various organs. The infection is diagnosed through blood tests and is treated with prolonged courses of antibiotics.ñ €¼br>

## Highlights

- Steady increase in case numbers over the years, with a notable peak in the summer months, suggesting a possible seasonal pattern. <br/>
- Mortality remains low, with occasional single death occurrences, indicating that Brucellosis, while spreading, is not generally causing high mortality. <br/>
- The spike in cases in early 2020 might be attributed to reduced reporting during the initial COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a catch-up in reporting as systems normalized. <br/>
- The highest recorded number of cases in a single month was in June 2021 (9670 cases), highlighting a significant outbreak or improved reporting mechanisms. <br/>

The reported data exhibits a clear seasonal trend in Brucellosis cases in mainland China, with cases generally peaking in the summer months from May to August. Over the years, there is also an apparent increasing trend in the number of cases, peaking in 2022. The highest number of cases within a single month was reported in June 2022 (9943 cases). In contrast, the winter months, particularly from November to February, tend to have the fewest reported cases, which can be partially attributed to seasonal occupational patterns and the lifecycle of the Brucella bacteria.

Brucellosis maintains a notably low mortality rate, with many months reporting zero deaths despite the high number of cases. The overall death count across the data set is minimal, totaling 21 fatalities from 2010 to 2023. Occasional spikes in mortality are observed, such as in July 2023 with a single death reported and September 2023 with two deaths. The low lethality of the disease underscores the effective management and treatment options available, although increases in case numbers do call for continued surveillance and control measures.

# Cholera 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Cholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. An individual can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the Vibrio cholerae bacteria. The disease is characterized by rapid dehydration due to severe diarrhea and vomiting. Without immediate treatment, cholera can be fatal within hours. Vaccinations and safe water and food practices play crucial roles in cholera prevention and control.

## Highlights

1. Overall decrease in Cholera cases: The data shows a significant overall decrease in cholera cases in mainland China over the years. This is positive and suggests successful management and control measures. <br/>
2. Seasonal variations observed: There are evident seasonality patterns, with more cases reported during the warmer months of May to October, hinting at possible environmental factors contributing to transmission. <br/>
3. Few fatalities: The number of deaths is extremely low compared to the total cases, pointing to effective medical treatments for affected patients. <br/>
4. A recent downtrend: Zero cases are reported for November 2023, following a slight increase in cases from May 2023, this could signal a decrease in the upcoming months, though continuous surveillance is advised. <br/>

Observing the cholera cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023, a noticeable seasonal pattern emerges. The majority of cases tend to occur during the warmer months from May to September. Cases are consistently low, often reaching zero, during the colder months from November to April. A peak was recorded in August 2010 with 63 cases, but the numbers remained relatively low in the subsequent years. Recent years show a mild increase in cases during the summer months, which requires continuous monitoring and preventive efforts.

Cholera, although a serious infectious disease, shows a low death rate from 2010 to 2023 in mainland China. Only two deaths occurred in the entire period, both in 2013, making the case-fatality rate extremely low. This low mortality rate suggests effective treatment and healthcare responses to cholera outbreaks. Considering cholera's potential for fast spread and high death rates in vulnerable populations, this highlights the success of integrated disease surveillance, immediate case reporting, and rapid case management.

# Cholera 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Cholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It's primarily contracted through consuming contaminated food or water and can cause severe dehydration if untreated. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and muscle cramps. It's common in regions with inadequate sanitation, poor nutrition, and lack of clean drinking water. Globally, cholera affects 1.3 to 4 million people and causes 21,000 to 143,000 deaths annually. Successful treatment typically involves rapid rehydration, with antibiotics if necessary. Vaccination and infrastructure improvements can help control cholera transmission.
## Highlights

- Cholera in Chinese mainland exhibits clear seasonality, with cases rising in July and August and dropping sharply towards winter, reflecting a seasonal endemic pattern. <br/>
- Over 13 years, only two deaths were reported, pointing to effective case management and possibly less virulent cholera strains. <br/>
- Cases fluctuate yearly without a consistent rise or decline, suggesting a stable epidemiological situation. <br/>
- As of November 2023, no reported cases or deaths continue to suggest controlled cholera spread within the region. <br/>

Cholera cases in mainland China have been sporadic from 2010 to 2023, with outbreaks primarily occurring between July and October, indicative of a seasonal pattern. The highest number of cases within a single month (63) was reported in August 2010. Overall, the data reflects low caseloads with occasional spikes, none exceeding that peak observed in 2010. The relatively consistent zero case reports during the winter and spring months suggest successful containment and/or a seasonal absence of disease transmission.

Remarkably, from 2010 to 2023, cholera-associated mortality in China has been exceedingly low, with only two recorded deaths amid the sporadically reported cases. Both fatalities occurred in 2013, in July and September, during typical peak cholera transmission periods. This low mortality rate indicates that despite the presence of cholera, China has effective treatment protocols and healthcare access, resulting in successful patient recovery from the infection.

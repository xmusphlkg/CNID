# Dengue

Version: November 2023

## Introduction

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. It is caused by the Dengue virus, which can manifest in varying degrees of illness, with severe forms causing hemorrhagic fever. Symptoms appear 4-10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito and can include fever, headache, rash, and joint and muscle pain. There is no specific treatment for Dengue, but early detection and proper medical care can help manage the symptoms.

## Highlights

1. There is a significant seasonality aspect to Dengue spread, with elevated case numbers annually observed in the months from July to November. <br/>
2. Major outbreak years since 2010 were 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, and 2019, with 2014 presenting the highest peak in recorded cases, numbering up to 28,796 in October. <br/>
3. While Dengue cases reduced significantly from 2020 to 2022, 2023 registered an unexpected increase in the incidence, especially in the months from July to October. <br/>
4. The number of deaths remained very low compared to the total cases, suggesting effective public health care and management of severe infections. <br/>

The data indicates variable degrees of Dengue fever incidence in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023. The reported cases are generally low during winter and early spring, attributed to decreased mosquito activity in cold months. There's a noticeable uptrend in Dengue cases from 2010 to 2014, followed by ebbs and flows in the subsequent years. This cyclical pattern of increase and decrease over years is often observed in mosquito-borne diseases due to the interplay between population immunity, vector population, and climatic factors. 2022 notably recorded a lower incidence, while 2023 witnessed a major outbreak in mid-year.

Overall, the fatality rate of Dengue fever incidents in Chinese mainland is minimal throughout the recorded period, suggestive of effective clinical management. However, a total of 10 deaths were reported from 2012 to 2023, with a peak in 2014 suggesting intensified disease activity or compromised healthcare delivery in this period. It's noteworthy that the fatality rate didn't significantly increase in 2023, the year with the highest number of cases, indicating possible improvements in disease surveillance, patient management, and community response. Yet, continuous vigilance is crucial to maintain and improve this trend.

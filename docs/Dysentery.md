# Dysentery 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the data provided, there is a noticeable seasonal pattern for dysentery cases in mainland China. The number of cases is highest during the summer months (June to August) and lowest during the winter months (December to February). This pattern suggests a potential link between dysentery transmission and warmer weather.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for dysentery cases in mainland China occurs in the summer months, specifically in July and August. During these months, the number of cases reaches its highest point, with values exceeding 35,000 cases in some years. Conversely, the trough period occurs in the winter months, with the lowest number of cases observed in December and January.

Overall Trends: 
Overall, there is a general upward trend in the number of dysentery cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. Although the number of cases varies from year to year, there is a gradual increase in the average number of cases over time. This suggests a potential rise in the burden of dysentery in the population.

Discussion: 
The seasonal pattern of dysentery cases in mainland China, with higher numbers during the summer months and lower numbers during the winter months, aligns with the known transmission dynamics of the disease. Dysentery is often caused by bacterial or parasitic infections, which can be more easily transmitted in warm and humid conditions. The peak in cases during the summer months may be attributed to factors such as increased travel, outdoor activities, and inadequate sanitation practices.

The overall upward trend in dysentery cases over the years is concerning and may indicate the need for improved prevention and control measures. It is crucial to investigate the underlying factors contributing to this trend, including changes in population demographics, sanitation practices, and access to healthcare. Furthermore, further analysis of the data, including an examination of specific regions within mainland China, may provide more insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of dysentery transmission.

It is worth noting that the provided data includes negative values for some months, particularly in the early years. These negative values may be a result of data reporting errors or inconsistencies and should be further investigated and corrected if necessary.

In conclusion, the analysis of monthly data on dysentery cases and deaths in mainland China reveals a distinct seasonal pattern, with peak periods during the summer months and trough periods during the winter months. Additionally, there is an overall upward trend in the number of cases over the years. These findings emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance and targeted interventions to prevent and control dysentery in mainland China.
## Introduction

Dysentery is an inflammatory disorder of the intestine, particularly of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing blood and mucus in the feces. It can be caused by either bacterial pathogens such as Shigella, Campylobacter, or E. coli, or by protozoan parasites like Entamoeba histolytica. The disease is typically spread through contaminated food or water and through person-to-person contact, often in areas with poor sanitation. Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, and urgent need to defecate. Treatment varies depending on the cause and may include antibiotics or antiparasitic medications, hydration, and rest.

## Highlights

- Dysentery cases in mainland China have shown a clear decreasing trend over the years, with a peak in 2010 and a significant reduction by October 2023. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns are evident, with cases typically increasing in the warmer months (May to August) and declining during the cooler months (November to April). <br/>
- Mortality has remained low with sporadic peaks, such as the unusual spike in September 2012, but deaths have generally been rare in the observed period. <br/>
- The public health interventions and improvements in sanitary conditions might have contributed to the continuous decrease in both morbidity and mortality associated with dysentery. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from 2010 to 2023 reveal a distinct seasonality in dysentery cases across mainland China, peaking during the summer months (June to August) and declining during winter. The highest number of cases recorded in a single month was 41,507 in August 2010, followed by a trend of decreasing annual peaks. A possible anomaly is observed in September 2012 with 23399 cases and an unusually high death toll. The recent years from 2020 to 2023 have shown a reduction in case numbers, potentially indicating improved public health measures, reporting changes, or other socio-environmental factors influencing transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, the number of deaths per month due to dysentery has generally been low, with a notable spike in September 2012 (198 deaths), warranting investigation into specific causes or reporting errors. Excluding this outlier, mortalities have remained in single digits or zero, suggesting a relatively low case-fatality ratio. The trend over the years does not display clear seasonality in deaths, with sporadic occurrences that are not evidently linked to the peaks in cases. This could indicate effective clinical management of cases and/or increased access to medical care and treatment options.

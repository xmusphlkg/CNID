# Echinococcosis 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns:

According to the provided data, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in the occurrence of Echinococcosis cases in mainland China. The number of cases tends to be higher from August to October, with a peak in October. From November to February, there is a decline in the number of cases, reaching a nadir in February. Subsequently, the number of cases gradually rises from March to July, with a smaller peak in July.

Peak and Trough Periods:

In mainland China, the peak period for Echinococcosis cases is observed in October, with the highest number of reported cases during this month. On the other hand, February represents the trough period, with the lowest number of reported cases.

Overall Trends:

Overall, there is an increasing trend in the occurrence of Echinococcosis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. Although there are variations from year to year, there is a general upward trend over time.

Discussion:

The observed seasonal patterns in the data indicate that there may be certain factors influencing the transmission of Echinococcosis in mainland China. The higher number of cases during August to October could be linked to environmental factors, such as increased contact with infected animals or changes in human behavior during this time. Conversely, the lower numbers during the winter months may be attributed to reduced outdoor activities and decreased exposure to the parasite.

The overall increasing trend in the number of cases over the years could be attributed to various factors, including improved surveillance and reporting systems, increased awareness and testing for Echinococcosis, changes in population dynamics, and alterations in environmental conditions that favor the transmission of the parasite.

Continued monitoring and examination of the seasonal patterns and overall trends of Echinococcosis in mainland China are essential to gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to its transmission. This knowledge can help in the development of effective prevention and control strategies.
## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a parasitic disease caused by the larvae of tapeworms belonging to the genus Echinococcus. The two most important forms of the disease in humans are cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by Echinococcus granulosus, and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), caused by Echinococcus multilocularis. Humans become accidental intermediate hosts through the ingestion of eggs from contaminated food, water, or soil, or through direct contact with definitive hosts such as dogs and other canids. The disease results in the formation of cysts mainly in the liver and lungs, and can be life-threatening if left untreated.

## Highlights

- Seasonal fluctuations in echinococcosis cases are apparent, with a trend toward higher incidence rates during the warmer months (May through September), suggesting possible seasonal factors in transmission dynamics. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, there is no clear long-term trend in the total number of cases; however, a peak is observed in December 2010 with 1065 cases. Few sporadic peaks occur in subsequent years. <br/>
- Mortality rates for echinococcosis remain very low throughout the observed period, with a total of 10 deaths reported from 2010 through October 2023, indicating potentially effective clinical management of the disease. <br/>
- Notably, there is a drop in the number of cases reported during February 2020, which may correspond with the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent public health measures affecting diagnosis or reporting. Cases seem to normalize shortly after, without a significant long-term decrease in incidence. <br/>


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between January 2010 and October 2023, Echinococcosis cases in mainland China exhibited seasonality, peaking mostly towards the year's end. The highest recorded cases occurred in March 2017, with 1,077 incidents. Overall, there were fluctuations with periods of increase and decrease in case numbers, potentially influenced by environmental factors, diagnostic improvements, reporting changes, or control measures. Monthly case numbers ranged from 91 to 1,077, demonstrating considerable variability. Data for January and February 2013 are missing, which represents a gap in this dataset.

### Deaths Analysis
The Echinococcosis fatality dataset from January 2010 to October 2023 shows very low mortality, with deaths reaching a count of only two in February 2019, the highest registered in this period. There are a total of 10 reported deaths, indicating a low case-fatality rate given the total number of cases. This may reflect effective clinical management or the non-lethal nature of the condition when appropriately treated. However, under-reporting cannot be dismissed without more context. Additionally, year-on-year death counts remain sporadic, making it difficult to discern any clear temporal trends.

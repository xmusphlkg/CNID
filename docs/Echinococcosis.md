# Echinococcosis

Version: November 2023

## Introduction

Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the Echinococcus genus. Humans contract it through ingestion of parasite eggs in contaminated food, water, or soil, or through direct contact with animal hosts. It involves two main types: cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE). Symptoms vary based on the affected organ and disease stage, often developing gradually over months or years. It is treatable through surgery, percutaneous techniques, drug therapy, or a watch-and-wait approach depending on the specific situation.

## Highlights

1. A consistent yearly pattern occurs with Echinococcosis cases peaking towards the end of the year, particularly in December, suggesting a seasonal influence on disease spread.<br/>
2. Despite occasional spikes (e.g., March 2017), there is an overall declining trend in Echinococcosis cases over the years, with the lowest number of cases seen recently in November 2022.<br/>
3. The fatality rate appears very low with sporadic occurrences of deaths over the years and near-null deaths in recent years, showing that the disease rarely results in death.<br/>
4. As of November 2023, the disease situation remains controlled, maintaining the general downward trend, although there is a slight increase in cases from earlier in 2023.<br/>

Data for Echinococcosis cases in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 demonstrate variations with low-reported periods followed by substantial spikes. The highest reported cases occurred in March 2017 with 1077 incidences. A downward trend is noticeable from 2018 onwards, signalling potential improvements in preventive measures or disease control strategies. However, even with decreases in reported cases, Echinococcosis remains a public health concern due to persistently high incidences.

The data indicates a very low fatality rate for Echinococcosis, with only 11 deaths reported out of tens of thousands of cases from 2010 to 2023. Despite these low numbers, the scattered occurrence of fatalities throughout the assessed period signifies the persistent danger of this disease. Proactive case management, swift diagnosis, and appropriate treatment regimes could be contributing factors to the low death rate. Importantly, these deaths underline the continued importance of preventive measures, education, and early detection.

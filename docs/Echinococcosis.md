# Echinococcosis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a parasitic disease caused by the echinococcus tapeworm. It predominantly affects the liver (70% of cases) and lungs (20% of cases) and is characterized by cyst formation. It's transmitted through the ingestion of parasite eggs released in animal feces, mainly from dogs. The disease is a public health concern in regions where individuals are exposed to dogs and livestock. Human echinococcosis is difficult to diagnose and treat, and in severe cases, it can be fatal.
## Highlights

- Seasonal peaks in echinococcosis are consistent, with higher incidences from July to December each year. <br/>
- Case numbers show no significant long-term trend, typically ranging from 200 to 600 monthly cases. <br/>
- Mortality remains exceptionally low, with sporadic deaths suggesting the rarity of fatal outcomes. <br/>
- A notable case drop in early 2020 might relate to COVID-19 impacts but cases reverted to the usual range thereafter. <br/>

Echinococcosis cases in Chinese mainland demonstrated seasonal fluctuation and year-to-year variability from 2010 to 2023. Peak incidences often occurred in the latter half of the year, with a notable spike in December 2010 (1065 cases). Starting in 2017, cases generally exceeded 400 per month more frequently, suggesting a rise in transmission or improved case detection. A sharp decline was observed in February 2020 (91 cases), potentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting disease reporting or healthcare access. Subsequently, cases remained relatively steady, with minor fluctuations but without returning to the highs seen in the previous decade.

Deaths from Echinococcosis in Chinese mainland were extremely rare across the observed period, with only 9 reported deaths from 2010 to 2023. Mortality events did not correlate directly with the peaks in case numbers, indicating that outbreaks didn't consistently result in higher death counts. The highest number of deaths in a single month was reported in February 2019, with 2 deaths. Overall, the fatality rate for Echinococcosis was very low, suggesting the potential for effective medical intervention or a propensity for reporting only the most severe cases as fatalities. The data points towards Echinococcosis being a health concern more for morbidity rather than mortality in Chinese mainland.

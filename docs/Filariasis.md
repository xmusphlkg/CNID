# Filariasis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Filariasis is a parasitic disease caused by an infection with roundworms belonging to the Filarioidea type. These parasites are spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito and dwell in a person's lymphatic system. The species of these worms that infect humans include Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori, associated with lymphatic filariasis, and Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa, causing onchocerciasis and loiasis respectively. The illness is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, often leading to lymphedema, elephantiasis, and in some cases, blindness.
## Highlights

- Filariasis shows an extremely low incidence in the Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023, with only three recorded cases and no reported deaths within this period. <br/>
- The cases occurred sporadically in August 2011, November 2014, and August 2021, suggesting rare but isolated outbreaks or incidental findings. <br/>
- The absence of reported deaths indicates that the disease, when present, has not led to fatalities, which may reflect effective case management and treatment. <br/>
- The general trend indicates that Filariasis is not a major public health concern in Chinese mainland during this timeframe, due to effective control strategies. <br/>

From 2010 to 2023, the Chinese mainland reported three isolated incidents of Filariasis with single cases in August 2011, November 2014, and August 2021. The temporal distribution of these cases spans over a decade and suggests sporadic occurrences without any discernible pattern or trend. The absence of reported cases in the majority of months over thirteen years indicates successful disease surveillance and control efforts, which have effectively limited the incidence of Filariasis in the region.

Throughout the same period from 2010 to 2023, there have been no reported deaths due to Filariasis in the Chinese mainland. This suggests either the cases that emerged were non-lethal strains or, more likely, that the cases were quickly identified and effectively treated. Additionally, the reporting mechanism appears robust, with consistent data maintenance. The absence of mortality reflects well on the healthcare infrastructure's capacity to manage such parasitic infections and the overall public health practices in place.

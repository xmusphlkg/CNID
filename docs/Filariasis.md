# Filariasis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Filariasis is a parasitic disease caused by an infection with roundworms of Filarioidea type. These are spread by blood-feeding insects such as black flies and mosquitoes. They affect multiple parts of the body including the lymphatic system and subcutaneous tissue, depending on the worm species. Three types of worm cause Filariasis: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. Major forms of the disease include lymphatic filariasis, affecting the lymphatic system, and onchocerciasis (river blindness), affecting the skin and eyes. Chronic infections can lead to conditions like elephantiasis.

## Highlights

- Filariasis appears to be very well-contained in Chinese mainland, with only 3 cases reported and no deaths from 2010 to November 2023. <br/>
- The sporadic cases occurred in August 2011, November 2014, and August 2021, suggesting a potential seasonality or localized transmission events. <br/>
- The consistent reporting of zero cases and deaths in the majority of months indicates an effective control and surveillance system for filariasis. <br/>
- The absence of any fatalities and the low case count over the years suggest that filariasis is not a significant public health concern in China as of the current data up to November 2023.

The data indicates an extremely low incidence of filariasis in the Chinese mainland over the 13-year span, presenting only two cases without seasonal variation. One reported case in August 2011 followed by another isolated case in August 2021 suggest sporadic occurrence without any concerning outbreak pattern. The consistent zero-case reports highlight effective control measures and possibly successful elimination strategies adopted by the region, aligning with China's lymphatic filariasis elimination status as recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Throughout the provided data period, there were no reported deaths due to filariasis in the Chinese mainland. This finding corroborates the negligible case incidence and indicates that the health system efficiently manages the few arising instances with appropriate treatment. The absence of fatalities underscores the success of public health interventions, including mass drug administration (MDA), vector control, and surveillance systems, in sustaining the elimination of filariasis as a public health problem.

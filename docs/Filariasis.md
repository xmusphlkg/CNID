# Filariasis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Filariasis is a group of tropical diseases caused by various species of parasitic worms. These thread-like nematode worms reside in the lymphatic system and blood vessels, causing severe damage. The two main types are Lymphatic filariasis (often leading to elephantiasis) and Onchocerciasis (or river blindness). Transmission occurs through insect bites, particularly mosquitoes, that harbor infective larvae. The global health burden is significant, primarily affecting populations in Africa and Asia. Despite serious health and socioeconomic impacts, filariasis is considered a neglected tropical disease. It's preventable and treatable, and global efforts are underway to eradicate it.


## Highlights

1. Extremely low occurrence: The data illustrates an extremely low incidence with 3 cases reported over the 13 year period and no fatalities due to Filariasis.<br/>
2. Sporadic Cases: The reported cases are sporadic, occurring in 2011, 2014, and 2021, with no pattern established.<br/>
3. Successful control: The data suggests successful disease control measures have been implemented as there are no significant outbreaks.<br/>
4. Current situation: As of November 2023, there have been no reported Filariasis cases for the year, maintaining the low incidence trend.<br/>

Throughout a thirteen-year period from 2010 to 2023, there were only three confirmed cases of Filariasis reported in mainland China: one in August 2011, one in November 2014, and one in August 2021. The periodically reported cases (spanning 3 years) suggest a low prevalence and an extended control period. It could be attributed to China’s intensified vector control strategies and the broad-scale administration of preventive antiparasitic drugs, as part of their effort in eliminating Filariasis, an infectious tropical disease caused by microscopic, thread-like worms.

As per the reported data, it is reassuring to note that there were zero deaths due to Filariasis from 2010 until 2023. This absence of mortality aligns with understanding that Filariasis is rarely fatal although chronic infections can bring debilitating complications. In conjunction, it is suggestive of successful medical interventions, public health measures and efficient case management implemented by healthcare authorities in Mainland China to neutralize this disease's impact.

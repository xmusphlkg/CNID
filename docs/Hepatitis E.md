# Hepatitis E 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), which can cause acute inflammation of the liver. The virus is typically transmitted via the fecal-oral route, through consumption of contaminated water or food. Although it often leads to a self-limiting illness, HEV can cause severe disease or a fulminant hepatic failure, particularly in pregnant women. There are four genotypes of HEV that infect humans, with geographical variations in prevalence. Currently, there is no specific treatment for hepatitis E, and prevention is primarily through improved sanitation and hygiene practices.

## Highlights

- A steady decrease in the number of Hepatitis E cases in Mainland China was observed from 2010 to 2022, with sporadic peaks in between and a considerable dip in 2020 before a gradual increase in 2021 and 2023. <br/>
- The death rate due to Hepatitis E is small and irregular, with no discernable pattern. The highest deaths of 6 in a month were observed in February 2010 and December 2017. <br/>
- As of September 2023, there were about 2550 reported cases with zero death, indicating a controlled situation. <br/>
- Despite the overall declining trend in cases, consistent vigilance and prevention measures are needed given sporadic increases.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis 
Hepatitis E cases in mainland China showed fluctuating patterns from 2010 to 2023. It's noteworthy that cases usually peaked in the first quarter of every year, especially in March. A significant decrease in cases was observed in 2020, likely due to stringent public health measures instituted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the cases got back to previous numbers by the end of 2021.

### Deaths Analysis
The data indicates a relatively low fatality rate for Hepatitis E across these years. Peaks of deaths were not consistent and occurred at different intervals. The highest count of deaths was observed in February 2010, and December 2017, with 6 instances each. The low death counts throughout the reported period suggest a high survival rate, possibly due to early detection and effective treatment. Interestingly, no significant increase in deaths was observed during periods with higher case numbers.

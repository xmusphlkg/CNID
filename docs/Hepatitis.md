# Hepatitis 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Hepatitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the liver, which can result in a range of health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. It can be caused by infectious agents like viruses, bacteria, and parasites (most commonly, the hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E), toxic substances like alcohol and certain drugs, or autoimmune disorders. Symptoms may include jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and nausea. Treatment and prognosis vary widely depending on the cause and severity of the liver inflammation. Vaccines are available for some types, such as hepatitis A and B.

## Highlights

- The number of Hepatitis cases in mainland China has shown an oscillating trend over the years with peaks typically occurring between April and September. <br/>
- Over the entire period, there has been no sustained reduction in cases suggesting that Hepatitis remains a significant public health issue. <br/>
- The mortality rate in most months remains low, with identified deaths typically less than 0.01% for most of the recorded period. <br/>
- However, a sharp increase in Hepatitis-associated deaths is seen from May 2023 suggesting an emerging public health emergency.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between 2010 and 2023, Hepatitis cases in mainland China showed significant fluctuations, often peaking in mid-year and declining towards year-end. The highest case count was recorded in August 2023 with 166,606 cases, and the lowest in February 2020 with 63,330. There was a visible drop in cases in 2020, potentially due to reinforced hygiene practices or reduced testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, but numbers rose again in 2021 and remained relatively high up to 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths from Hepatitis also demonstrated variability but remained generally low with a slight increase over time. From 2010 to 2022, deaths per month ranged mainly between 30 and 90. However, there was a sharp increase in 2023, with a peak in June at 206 deaths. This surge suggests a worsening situation, potentially due to increased virulence of the virus or challenges in healthcare provision.

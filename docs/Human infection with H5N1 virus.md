# Human infection with H5N1 virus 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, there is no distinct seasonal pattern observed for human infection with the H5N1 virus in mainland China prior to October 2023. The number of cases and deaths fluctuates throughout the years without a consistent pattern.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The data does not reveal any clear peak and trough periods. The number of cases and deaths remains relatively low and sporadic, with occasional spikes in certain months.

Overall Trends: 
Overall, the data indicates a low and sporadic number of cases and deaths resulting from human infection with the H5N1 virus in mainland China prior to October 2023. There is no significant upward or downward trend observed in the data.

Discussion: 
The data provided suggests that human infection with the H5N1 virus in mainland China has remained relatively low and sporadic prior to October 2023. This aligns with the historical pattern of the H5N1 virus, which is known to cause sporadic outbreaks in humans with limited sustained human-to-human transmission.

It is important to note that the data only includes cases and deaths, and does not account for the population at risk, surveillance efforts, or control measures implemented during the specified period. Further analysis and interpretation of the data would require additional information and context.

Additionally, it should be mentioned that the negative values observed for some months in the data (e.g., -10 cases and deaths) may be attributed to data reporting errors or inconsistencies. These values should be verified and corrected, if necessary, prior to conducting further analysis.

In summary, the data implies that there is no clear seasonal pattern, peak and trough periods, or significant overall trends in human infection with the H5N1 virus in mainland China prior to October 2023. Continued surveillance and monitoring of H5N1 virus activity is crucial to detect and respond to any potential outbreaks in the future.
## Introduction

Human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, commonly known as bird flu, is an infectious disease caused by a subtype of the influenza virus that primarily affects birds but can cross the species barrier to infect humans. The first case in humans was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. Infection in humans is rare but often severe, leading to high mortality rates. Transmission typically occurs through close contact with infected birds or environments contaminated with the virus. Human-to-human transmission is currently limited, with most cases traced to direct bird exposure.

## Highlights

- H5N1 infection in mainland China over the past decade demonstrates sporadic human cases with occasional fatalities, reflecting intermittent zoonotic transmission rather than sustained human-to-human spread. <br/>
- The data show a low incidence of human H5N1 cases, with a total of 14 cases and 11 deaths reported from 2010 to 2023, indicating effective surveillance and control measures. <br/>
- While the case fatality rate is high, approximately 79% among the reported cases, the sporadic nature and absence of cases for extended periods suggest a well-contained risk. <br/>
- Recent data up to October 2023 shows no new cases or deaths, which could imply that the current disease situation is stable, with no immediate concern for a public health emergency related to H5N1. <br/>

From 2010 to 2023, mainland China recorded sporadic human cases of H5N1, with a total of 13 cases. The data follows a random distribution, predominantly with zero cases per month. Notable clusters occur in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, and 2016, but the frequency and distribution of cases do not suggest a sustained human-to-human transmission. The presence of singular cases, rather than outbreaks, implies occasional zoonotic spillover events, potentially from contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments.

The data indicates a total of 10 deaths from H5N1 infection in the specified period, yielding an overall high case-fatality ratio. Deaths are tightly correlated with reported cases, which is expected for a pathogen with a high fatality rate among symptomatic individuals. Anomalies are observed in February 2016 and May 2015, which report discrepancies between cases and deaths, suggesting retrospective confirmation of fatalities or reporting lags. The mortality data underscores the severe risk posed by H5N1, despite the low incidence rate.

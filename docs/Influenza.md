# Influenza 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Influenza, commonly known as flu, is a highly contagious viral infection of the respiratory tract. It can severely affect individuals of any age but is especially dangerous for the elderly, children, and those with compromised immune systems. Common symptoms include fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, congestion, runny nose, headaches, and fatigue. Influenza is primarily transmitted via droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Vaccines are available and recommended annually to prevent infection and limit the spread of the virus.
## Highlights

- Significant surge in influenza cases observed in March 2023 with a record high of 3,721,370 cases and 38 deaths, suggesting a major outbreak. <br/>
- Following March 2023, there was a notable decline but cases remained high with 1,677,011 in April, decreasing to 186,2998 by November, indicating a possible stabilization or control of the outbreak. <br/>
- Despite the high volume of cases in 2023, the mortality rate appears low, with only 1 death recorded for the 1,862,998 cases in November, pointing towards a potentially less virulent strain or effective clinical management. <br/>
- Overall, 2023 shows an unprecedented spike in cases compared to previous years, necessitating ongoing public health monitoring and possibly enhanced vaccination strategies. <br/>

From January 2010 to November 2023, Chinese mainland experienced fluctuating influenza cases with periods of significant surges. Cases gradually increased until 2012, with occasional spikes commonly seen during the start of a new year, likely due to increased indoor activity during winter. The highest peaks occurred in December 2019, March 2023, and November 2023, indicating potential outbreaks or improved surveillance. The data from March 2013 and February 2013 are missing, which could indicate reporting issues. A sharp decrease in cases was noticed in early 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic's outbreak and associated public health measures.

The fatality rate, as seen from the reported deaths, was relatively low from January 2010 to November 2023. Notable increases in deaths were observed in January and February of 2014, 2018, 2019, and notably 2020 when 108 deaths were reported alongside a large case count, suggesting a severe influenza period or concurrent health crises like COVID-19. The death counts spiked again in March and April 2023, despite relatively lower case numbers in preceding months, hinting at either a more virulent influenza strain or potential co-infections. General trends show increased deaths during the winter months, which aligns with typical influenza seasonality.

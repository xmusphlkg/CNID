# Kala azar 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in mainland China regarding cases of Kala azar. The number of cases tends to be higher from October to March, with the highest point occurring in October and November. Conversely, from April to September, the number of cases generally decreases, reaching the lowest point in August. This pattern suggests a seasonal variation in the transmission of Kala azar in mainland China.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Kala azar cases in mainland China is observed during October and November, reporting the highest number of cases during these months. In contrast, the trough period occurs in August, reporting the lowest number of cases. This indicates a clear seasonal fluctuation in the occurrence of Kala azar cases.

Overall Trends: 
When considering the overall trends, there is a general increase in the number of Kala azar cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2015. The number of cases reaches its highest point in 2015, with a peak of 123 cases reported in November. Following 2015, there is a gradual decline in the number of cases, with some observed fluctuations. Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that the provided data only extends until October 2023, making it difficult to determine the long-term trend beyond this point.

Discussion: 
The observed seasonal patterns in the data imply that the transmission of Kala azar in mainland China is influenced by environmental factors that vary throughout the year. The peak in cases during October and November may be attributed to factors such as temperature, humidity, and vector abundance, which are known to impact the dynamics of disease transmission. The decrease in cases during the summer months could be due to factors like reduced vector activity or changes in human behavior, such as an increased utilization of protective measures.

The overall trend of increasing cases from 2010 to 2015, followed by a decline in subsequent years, may indicate the successful implementation of control measures during that period. However, it is crucial to continue monitoring the situation and implementing appropriate interventions to prevent a resurgence of Kala azar cases in mainland China.

It is noteworthy that the provided data includes negative values for some months, particularly in the deaths column. These negative values may stem from data entry errors or other factors, and should be verified and corrected if necessary to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

Overall, the analysis of the data demonstrates a clear seasonal pattern and fluctuations in the number of Kala azar cases in mainland China. Continuous surveillance and control efforts are of utmost importance in effectively managing and preventing the spread of this disease.
## Introduction

Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is a life-threatening disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. It is transmitted through the bites of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. The disease primarily affects the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, leading to fever, weight loss, anemia, and enlargement of the spleen and liver. If untreated, it has a high fatality rate. Kala-azar is endemic in regions of Asia, East Africa, South America, and the Mediterranean basin. Treatment includes antimonial compounds, amphotericin B, miltefosine, and other antiparasitic drugs.

## Highlights

- A gradual decline in Kala azar cases from 2010 to 2023, with intermittent peaks suggesting episodic outbreaks. <br/>
- Low mortality overall, with occasional deaths suggesting the potential for fatal outcomes, highlighting the need for continued surveillance and healthcare response. <br/>
- A notable increase in cases from July to October 2023, with 30 cases in July, a slight decrease to 26 in August and September, and 19 in October, indicating a recent spike that warrants investigation. <br/>
- The persistent presence of Kala azar cases in mainland China over the 2010-2023 period underlines the endemic nature of the disease, with implications for both public health planning and long-term prevention strategies. <br/>

From January 2010 to October 2023, mainland China reported 3,792 cases of Kala azar with fluctuations over the years. Cases peaked at 123 in November 2015 before generally trending downward. Notably, seasonal patterns emerge, with higher incidences typically in the latter half of the year, potentially associated with vector population cycles. The data for January and February 2013 is missing, which could affect interpretability. Despite some year-to-year variation, there is an overall decline in cases, particularly notable after 2015 with sporadic upsurges.

Over the same period, there were 10 reported deaths among the Kala azar cases in mainland China. The fatality rate remained low, with deaths occurring sporadically rather than annually (years 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020, 2022, 2023). As such, no discernible pattern or trend in deaths is evident, and the fatality rate is too low to extrapolate seasonality or other demographic factors definitively influencing mortality. The data reflects successful case management and possibly effective control measures leading to low mortality despite the presence of the disease. 

(Note: The analysis does not include a full assessment of the impact of potential under-reporting, misdiagnosis, or other surveillance artifacts that might affect the accuracy of the reported data.)

# Leprosy 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious condition caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. Distinguished by skin lesions and peripheral nerve damage, leprosy can lead to severe physical impairment if left untreated. It spreads via droplet infection from close and frequent contact with untreated patients. The disease has effective treatments available, such as Multidrug Therapy (MDT), dramatically reducing its global prevalence but it's still present in certain regions.
## Highlights

1. There has been a significant decrease in reported Leprosy cases over the years, from an average of around 80 per month in 2010 to around 30 in 2023, indicating effective control measures. <br/>
2. Leprosy-related deaths are sporadic and not significantly correlated to the increasing/decreasing trends of reported cases, with an average less than 1 death per month throughout. <br/>
3. The number of cases varies within the year, with peaks generally occurring in Spring (February-March-April) and troughs in Autumn-Winter (October-November), indicating a possible seasonality. <br/>
4. As of November 2023, the situation seems to be under control, but continuous surveillance and control measures are still essential to maintain the decreasing trend and prevent resurgence.

The given data demonstrates a declining trend of Leprosy cases in China from 2010 to 2023. Initially, fluctuations in case count were observed with counts veering between 41 and 127 (2010-2012). The number generally diminished, however, over the years with greater consistency, dropping to under 100 consistently by 2014. By 2023, no month exceeded 43 cases, indicating a significant reduction in new leprosy incidences. The reduction may be due to successful public health initiatives, increased awareness, improved diagnostics, or increased access to medical treatment.

The Leprosy death count remained relatively low throughout the period, demonstrating a sporadic distribution and fluctuating annually between 0 - 1 deaths per month. This suggests a relatively low fatality rate, potentially a testament to effective treatment strategies and early detection protocols in the country. The random distribution of deaths depicts a situation where Leprosy is well-managed, with deaths possibly associated more with individual health situations or delayed diagnoses than with the disease's innate severity.

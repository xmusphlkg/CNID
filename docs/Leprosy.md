# Leprosy 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Primarily affecting the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the respiratory tract, and the eyes, it can lead to severe disfigurement and disability. Leprosy is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical environments. Although it is slow-progressing and not highly contagious, the disease can transmit via droplets from the nose or mouth of untreated patients. Early diagnosis and multidrug therapy are crucial to prevent complications. The World Health Organization provides free treatment worldwide to eradicate leprosy.
## Highlights

- A downward trend in leprosy cases is observed, progressing from an average of 77 cases per month in 2010 to approximately 27 cases per month in 2023. <br/>
- Deaths associated with leprosy are rare, with most months recording zero deaths since 2010 and no recorded deaths in 2023. <br/>
- Occasional spikes in cases, such as in March 2012 (127 cases) and March 2013 (124 cases), suggest periodic increases which may be indicative of localized outbreaks or improved case detection. <br/>
- The current situation as of November 2023 indicates control with 34 cases and no deaths, consistent with the general declining pattern of leprosy incidence in Chinese mainland. <br/>

From the provided data, leprosy cases in Chinese mainland from January 2010 to November 2023 show minor fluctuations with a general downtrend in the latter years. Initial counts peaked at 127 in March 2012 and often exceeded 70 cases monthly until 2016. Post-2016, the number of cases generally declined, with only a few instances reaching above 60. Since 2020, there's a notable reduction in reported cases, maintaining a monthly count mostly below 40, suggesting either improved control measures or under-reporting.

Leprosy-associated deaths in Chinese mainland are exceedingly rare throughout the observed period. A total of 7 deaths occurred, with no year experiencing more than one fatality. Six out of the seven years with reported deaths had a single death, highlighting the low mortality associated with leprosy in this region during this timeframe. There seems to be no apparent monthly or seasonal pattern to the deaths, indicating mortality might be due to sporadic cases with severe complications or comorbidities.

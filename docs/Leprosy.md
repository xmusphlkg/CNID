# Leprosy 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious illness caused by Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis bacteria. The disease primarily impacts the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. Its main symptoms include severe, disfiguring skin sores and nerve damage. Although feared as a highly contagious and devastating condition, leprosy can now be effectively treated, especially when diagnosed early. Approximately 200,000 new cases are identified annually, predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions.

## Highlights

- Over the 13-year period from 2010-2023, there has been a consistent reduction in the number of new Leprosy cases recorded in mainland China. There's an evident downward trend, indicating progress in the control of the disease.<br/>
- Notably, the highest number of cases appears to be reported during the first half of the year, with numbers typically peaking around March to May. Seasonal patterns suggest targeted interventions may be crucial during these times.<br/>
- The death rates due to Leprosy over these years have been low, indicating effective management and treatment of the condition in diagnosed cases. There are isolated occurrences of deaths; however, they do not indicate any consistent trend.<br/>
- As of November 2023, Leprosy seems to be well under control, represented by the lower case count (34), following the general trend of the past few years. Continued vigilance and preventive measures are, however, essential to sustain this progress.

According to the data sourced from 2010 to 2023, mainland China has showed a generally declining trend with regard to the incidence of reported leprosy cases. From an average of around 80 cases in the initial years, new diagnosed cases progressively decreased to just around 30 during the later part of the recorded scenario. It's noteworthy that the peaks of cases tend to occur in the first quarter of each year, with the trend normally plateauing throughout the year afterwards. This pattern signifies the cyclical nature of the disease's occurrence.

Even though the total leprosy cases decreased overall, the number of deaths remained alarmingly stable. The death count was encapsulated at either zero or one per month, only ranging between these two figures throughout the years 2010 to 2023. This indicates an effective treatment and control measure put in place over the years, maintaining a low mortality. Factors contributing to this could be early disease detection, effective clinical management, increased awareness, and prompt initiation of treatment.

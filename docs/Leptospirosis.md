# Leptospirosis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by Leptospira bacteria, often transmitted through the urine of infected animals. Both domestic and wild animals can serve as carriers, including cows, dogs, rodents, and more. Humans can contract the disease by coming in direct contact with infected animals' urine, or indirectly through a contaminated environment. Symptoms may range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe manifestations like kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, and respiratory complications. Timely antibiotic treatment is crucial for infected individuals to prevent severe health outcomes.
## Highlights

- Seasonal pattern with peak incidence from July to October, indicating a higher transmission risk during warmer, wet months.<br/>
- Stable number of cases over the years without major outbreaks; however, there are sporadic peaks that could indicate localized increases in transmission.<br/>
- The fatality rate appears low and inconsistent, with occasional spikes in deaths which may suggest variable severity or reporting.<br/>
- The disease trend in November 2023, with 25 cases and 0 deaths, suggests ongoing transmission but effective case management, assuming consistent reporting and case detection.<br/>

The leptospirosis case data from Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 indicate a seasonal pattern with an increase in cases during the warmer, wetter months (May through October), peaking mostly in August and September. The highest number of cases reported in a single month was 141 in September 2012. There is a notable decline in cases starting from November. Annually, the case counts appear relatively consistent, with no drastic upward trends, suggesting stable transmission rates or effective control measures.

From 2010 to 2023, deaths due to leptospirosis in Chinese mainland have been relatively infrequent, with most months reporting zero fatalities. The highest mortality in a single month was 7, observed in both September and October of 2010. Fatalities are sporadic but align with periods of case surges, indicating potential severity during peak transmission months. The overall fatality rate remains low, indicating that while outbreaks are periodic, they may generally be controlled, resulting in limited deaths.

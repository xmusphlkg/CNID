# Leptospirosis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects both humans and animals. It is caused by corkscrew-shaped bacteria called leptospira. The condition can be caught through direct contact with urine from infected animals or by water, soil, or food contaminated with their urine. Symptoms vary from very mild and non-specific to severe disease with kidney or liver failure, lung hemorrhage, or meningitis. It's most common in tropical climates but can occur anywhere. The infection can be confirmed using laboratory tests. Treatment typically includes antibiotics.
## Highlights

- Seasonality is pronounced in leptospirosis cases, peaking from June to October, potentially due to climatic conditions favoring bacterial proliferation. <br/>
- Over the years, case numbers have shown variability, with significant increases in certain years like 2010 and 2012. Recent trends indicate a decrease post-2021. <br/>
- Mortality rates have stayed consistently low, with deaths mostly occurring in peak months. This suggests effective case management and public health measures. <br/>
- As of November 2023, there's stability with 25 reported cases and no deaths, reflecting controlled disease transmission and intervention success. <br/>

Leptospirosis cases in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023 demonstrate a distinct seasonality, with the majority of cases occurring from June to October, indicating a possible correlation with the warm and wet summer months conducive to the spread of the disease. The peak of cases generally happens in September, suggesting environmental factors may contribute to enhanced transmission during this period. The consistent presence of cases each year indicates stable endemicity, yet with some fluctuations in annual caseloads that might be attributed to varying environmental conditions or public health interventions.

Mortality associated with Leptospirosis over the years shows an overall low fatality rate, with some years experiencing slightly higher death counts (e.g., 2010 September and October). Deaths are sporadically distributed, with no clear pattern or trend observed. The highest number of deaths in a single month was seven, which occurred twice, in September and October of 2010. The data does not indicate any significant mortality spikes that would suggest major outbreaks, hinting at either timely diagnosis and treatment or a predominance of less severe leptospiral strains.

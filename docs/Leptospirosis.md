# Leptospirosis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by the Leptospira bacteria. Also known as Weil's disease, it's typically transmitted to humans through direct contact with the urine of infected animals or by water, soil, or food contaminated with urine. The disease can lead to varying symptoms ranging from fever, headache, and muscle aches, to severe conditions like kidney damage, meningitis and liver failure. High-risk groups include people who work with animals or in wet environments. Vaccinations are available for certain animal species, but not for humans.
## Highlights

- Seasonal variation is evident in the leptospirosis data, with case numbers consistently peaking during the warmer, rainy summer months (June through October) and declining during the winter. <br/>
- The highest number of cases within the given timeframe was observed in the months of August and September across multiple years, signifying a potential pattern of heightened transmission during this period. <br/>
- The fatality rate appears to be low, with deaths being relatively rare events in comparison to the number of cases reported. However, there are occasional spikes in deaths that coincide with larger outbreaks. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the disease situation shows a continued presence of leptospirosis with 25 cases and no deaths, indicating ongoing transmission but with effective clinical management preventing fatalities. <br/>

Leptospirosis cases in Chinese mainland demonstrate a clear seasonal pattern, with the lowest incidence generally occurring in winter months (December-February) and peaking during summer and early autumn (June-October). The highest number of cases was reported in September 2012 with 141 cases. Over the years, reported cases have seen a slight overall decline, with sporadic upsurges. The year 2014 ended with an unusual spike of 207 cases in December, deviating from typical seasonal trends.

Fatalities due to Leptospirosis are relatively uncommon compared to the total cases, with several months reporting no deaths. The highest mortality within a month was noted in September and October of 2010 with 7 deaths each. Death counts do not appear to follow a strict seasonal trend, suggesting a possible impact of variable factors such as timely access to healthcare or the virulence of Leptospira strains. Noteworthy is the declining trend in deaths post-2010, indicating improvements in disease management and prevention.

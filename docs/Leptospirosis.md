# Leptospirosis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects both humans and animals. It is caused by bacteria of the Leptospira type. In humans, it can cause a wide range of symptoms, some of which may not be immediately recognizable. It is transmitted through the urine of infected animals, which can get into water or soil and survive for weeks to months. Humans contract the disease through direct contact with urine from infected animals, or through water, soil, or food contaminated with their urine. Severe cases can lead to kidney damage, liver failure, and death.

## Highlights

1. Annual Clusters: There are identifiable peaks in reported cases during summer and fall, predominantly between July and October each year. <br/>
2. Stability in Case Counts: The number of cases remained stable over the years, with a slight decline in 2023, marking a decrease in seasonality effect. <br/>
3. Seasonality Impact: Cases in November continue to decline, indicating a decrease in disease transmission, possibly due to environmental or preventative health measures. <br/>
4. Low Mortality: The mortality rate for Leptospirosis remains extremely low, with some years experiencing zero reported deaths.

The data reflects a repeated pattern of leptospirosis cases fluctuating throughout the years, with the majority of incidences occurring during the late summer and early autumn months (July to October). This could potentially be attributed to seasonal changes, specifically increased rainfall encouraging the growth of Leptospira bacteria. Notably, the peak in leptospirosis cases was in September 2012 with 141 cases. The low number of cases in the early years and the gradual increase seen up to 2022, may indicate an improving capacity for disease detection or a growing infection rate.

Death from leptospirosis remains a rare occurrence within the analysed period, with the most deaths associated with the disease reaching 7 in both September and October 2010. As with incidence rates, deaths also seem to slightly peak during the same months of late summer to early autumn. Despite the rise in cases over the years, there hasn't been a significant increase in related fatalities, suggesting possible improvements in medical treatments, immunization, or public health interventions.

# Leptospirosis 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals, caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. It is transmitted through direct contact with urine from infected animals or a urine-contaminated environment, often occurring in water. The bacteria can enter the body through cuts in the skin or mucous membranes. Symptoms range from mild flu-like manifestations to severe illness with kidney failure, jaundice, and bleeding. Leptospirosis is a global health concern, particularly in tropical regions and areas with poor sanitation. Vaccines are available for animals, and antibiotic treatment is effective in humans when administered early.

## Highlights

- Leptospirosis cases in mainland China peak annually around the late summer/autumn months (August to October), likely correlating with a seasonal influence.<br/>
- Despite regular yearly fluctuations in total cases, there has been no significant overall increasing or decreasing trend in the incidence of Leptospirosis from 2010 to 2023.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between 2010 and 2023, mainland China had sporadic cases of Leptospirosis. Typically, new cases were at a low during the start of the year and rose steadily towards the second half. The most considerable spikes often occurred in September. Some noticeable peaks include September 2010 (112 cases), September 2011 (104), and September 2020 (110). On the downside, the lowest number of cases were often recorded in February, with an all-time low in 2022. Overall, fluctuations across the period show a cyclical pattern, suggesting a possible correlation with climatic conditions or human activities.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, deaths were few but shared a similar pattern with cases, notably peaking during the autumn or late summer season. The highest fatalities were recorded in September and October of 2020, both recording seven deaths each. Deaths remained null or rare during the first half of the year, especially January and February. The total deaths were significantly lower compared to total cases, implying effective medical intervention and response for leptospirosis in mainland China. However, the periodic rise in fatalities still calls for improved prevention strategies during risk-prone months.

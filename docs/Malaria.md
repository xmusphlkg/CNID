# Malaria 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. There are four main types of malaria-causing parasites: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale, with P. falciparum being the most deadly. Once inside the human host, the parasites multiply in the liver before infecting and destroying red blood cells. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, and vomiting, and can appear several days after the mosquito bite. If not treated promptly with effective medication, malaria can be fatal.

## Highlights

1. The number of Malaria cases in mainland China has generally decreased over the years, from report highs in 2010 to significantly lower figures in 2023.<br/>
2. Despite some yearly fluctuation and an observed increase in 2022, the overall case frequency still shows a downward trend.<br/>
3. Mortality due to malaria is relatively low and fluctuates minimally, with no significant increase or decrease over the years.<br/>
4. As of September 2023, the number of reported cases is 193 with 1 reported death, which aligns with the trend of decreasing cases, despite the slight increase reported in 2023.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Malaria cases in mainland China depict a considerable fluctuation over a period of 13 years, yet there is an overall decreasing trend. A high number of cases were reported in 2010, recording a peak of 1094 cases in August 2010. However, the numbers had a noticeable decline after 2010 and then maintained relatively lower rates constantly changing from 2012 until recent years. The significant drop in 2020, with numbers going below 100, is notable, which might be contributed by stringent health measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A slight increase can be observed from 2021, but the figures were still kept below 300 till 2023. 

### Deaths Analysis
Despite fluctuations in the number of cases, the death toll remained relatively low throughout the years with one exceptional surge to 32 deaths in September 2012. Most months reported an average death count of less than 5. No significant pattern can be identified in the distribution of deaths. The highest number of deaths registered each year has been decreasing progressively from 2010 onwards, indicating potentially improved treatment strategies or more extensive preventative measures. By 2020, there were some months where no deaths were reported, indicating progress in Malaria management in China.

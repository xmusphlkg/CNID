# Malaria 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to people through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Predominantly found in tropical and subtropical climates, it poses a significant health risk, causing symptoms like fever, chills, and flu-like illness. Five species of Plasmodium parasites cause malaria in humans, with Plasmodium falciparum being the deadliest. Despite worldwide efforts, the World Health Organization reports hundreds of thousands of malaria-related deaths annually, primarily among children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Effective control measures include rapid diagnosis and treatment, and preventative measures such as insecticide-treated nets.
## Highlights

1. Malaria cases have shown a significant decrease from 2010 to 2023. The highest number of cases reported was in 2010 (10,938) and the lowest in 2022 (847).<br/>
2. A seasonal pattern is observable, with the peak number of cases usually around May-July, and then a gradual decrease until the end of each year.<br/>
3. The number of deaths due to Malaria remains relatively low throughout, although inconsistency in the counts can be observed. The highest fatality was in September 2012 with 32 deaths.<br/>
4. As of November 2023, the situation seems controlled with 183 cases and no deaths. However, this is a slight increase from the 74 cases in November 2022, indicating a potential increase in transmission.<br/>

The malaria cases in mainland China display a general pattern of decline since 2010, with some seasonal variation. There is an apparent surge in cases during the middle of each year, typically peaking around June or July. These peaks gradually lessen over the years, although the recent oscillatory increase in the mid-year cases since 2020 suggests that continued vigilance is required. Despite slight upticks, the general trajectory suggests successful interventions and robust public health measures.

The number of deaths due to malaria throughout 2010-2023 remains relatively low, indicating efficient clinical management. There is a noticeable peak of 32 deaths in September 2012, the underlying cause of this anomaly would need further investigation. Overall, the number of deaths due to malaria has remained consistently low since 2014, generally not exceeding five deaths per month. This low mortality rate, despite slight variations in case prevalence, implies effective treatment strategies and improved healthcare access, even in instances of increased malaria transmission.

# Measles 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the measles virus. It's notorious for its severity, particularly in unvaccinated populations. The illness presents symptoms after a 10-12 day incubation period, such as high fever, cough, runny nose, and characteristic red rash. Transmission occurs through direct contact or air when infected persons cough or sneeze. The measles vaccine, included in the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine, is a highly effective measure to prevent the disease. Despite vaccine availability, measles remains a leading cause of death among young children globally.
## Highlights

- A marked reduction in measles cases is observed from 2010, with peak numbers declining sharply by 2023. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns are discernible with cases often rising in the spring months, though this effect diminishes over time. <br/>
- Death toll from measles has significantly decreased, with no reported deaths in the years following 2019. <br/>
- As of November 2023, there are 78 cases of measles reported with zero deaths, highlighting sustained low-level transmission.

The data for measles cases in Chinese mainland depict a dramatic decrease over the years. An initial peak in 2010, with a high of 13,318 cases in May, significantly dropped in subsequent years. Notably, there was an absence of data for early 2013. From 2014 onwards, the number of cases consistently diminished, reaching double digits by 2018, and further declining post-2020. The sharp reduction in cases, particularly from 2020, could be attributed to enhanced vaccination efforts, improved public health measures, and possibly impacts of COVID-19-related social distancing and containment strategies.

Reports of measles-related deaths showed a declining trend consistent with the decrease in case numbers. While the highest reported deaths within a month was 12 in May 2010, subsequent years saw a significant reduction to zero or single-digit monthly fatalities. The last reported measles death occurred in November 2015, and no further deaths were reported post-2016. This suggests an effective case management and possibly improvements in the health care delivery system, coupled with vaccination campaigns that not only lessened measles incidence but also drastically reduced mortality.

# Meningococcal meningitis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Meningococcal meningitis is a severe bacterial infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, caused by Neisseria meningitidis. This disease is potentially fatal and requires immediate medical attention. It's most commonly transmitted through respiratory droplets or close contact with an infected person. Symptoms include headache, fever, and stiff neck, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and mental confusion. Vaccination is a key strategy for prevention, targeted at high-risk groups, especially in regions with high disease prevalence.

## Highlights

- A significant decrease in meningococcal meningitis cases and deaths has been observed from 2010 to 2023. The peak numbers in earlier years (68 cases in March 2010) have not been replicated in recent years (maximum 15 cases in March 2023). <br/>
- Seasonality in meningococcal meningitis is evident, with higher incidence typically in the late winter and early spring months (January to March), demonstrated by peaks during those months across several years. <br/>
- The mortality associated with meningococcal meningitis has also dropped, with recent years showing very low to no deaths, suggesting improvements in public health measures, vaccination, and treatment protocols. <br/>
- The data for November 2023 shows 12 cases with no associated deaths, consistent with a continued low-incidence trend and effective case management and preventive measures. <br/>

An evaluation of Meningococcal meningitis cases in China from 2010 to 2023 reveals seasonal patterns, with peaks commonly in early spring months. The data indicates a substantial decrease in cases over time, from highs of 68 in March 2010 to single digits in multiple months of more recent years. Such a decline could be attributed to increased vaccination, public health measures, or underreporting. Although data for January and February 2013 is missing, no significant outbreaks are noted in subsequent reports, suggesting stable endemicity or effective control measures in place.

Mortality associated with Meningococcal meningitis in China shows a decreasing trend from 2010 to 2023. Initial years saw a mortality peak in March 2010 with seven deaths, while recent years have months with no reported deaths. The mortality rate fluctuates, with some months having a higher ratio of deaths to cases. This variable lethality could point towards differing virulence of strains, access to healthcare, or changes in reporting practices. The consistent low death rates in later years potentially reflect improvements in disease management, treatment protocols, and public health interventions.

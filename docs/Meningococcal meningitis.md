# Meningococcal meningitis 

Version: October 2023 

There appears to be a seasonal pattern in the cases of Meningococcal meningitis in mainland China, as indicated by the provided data. The number of cases tends to be higher during the winter and spring months (December to April) and lower during the summer and fall months (May to November). This pattern suggests a peak in cases during the colder months and a decrease during the warmer months.

The peak period for Meningococcal meningitis cases in mainland China occurs from December to April, during the winter and spring months. During this period, there is generally a higher number of cases compared to other months. On the other hand, the trough period occurs from May to November, during the summer and fall months, when there is generally a lower number of cases.

There is an overall decreasing trend in the number of Meningococcal meningitis cases in mainland China prior to October 2023. From 2010 to 2013, there is a gradual increase in cases, followed by a period of fluctuation from 2014 to 2016. After 2016, there is a general decrease in cases, with some fluctuations in between. It is important to note that the data for 2023 is only available until October, so the overall trend for the entire year cannot be determined based on the provided data.

The observed seasonal pattern in the cases of Meningococcal meningitis in mainland China suggests a higher risk of transmission during the winter and spring months. This may be attributed to various factors, such as increased indoor crowding, closer contact between individuals, and lower humidity levels during the colder months, which may facilitate the spread of the bacteria causing the disease.

The overall decreasing trend in cases after 2016 is a positive indication, suggesting that efforts to control and prevent Meningococcal meningitis in mainland China may have been effective. However, continued monitoring of the situation and implementation of appropriate preventive measures are important to sustain this downward trend.

It is worth noting that the analysis is based solely on the provided data, and a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of Meningococcal meningitis in mainland China would be obtained by considering additional information, such as population demographics, vaccination coverage, and public health interventions.
## Introduction

Meningococcal meningitis is a serious infection of the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord, caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. This bacterium can also lead to bloodstream infections (meningococcemia). It spreads through respiratory droplets or close contact. Symptoms include stiff neck, fever, headache, vomiting, and confusion. Vaccination can prevent some strains, and early treatment with antibiotics is critical for survival. Meningococcal disease can cause severe long-term complications or death if not treated promptly. It commonly affects young children, but outbreaks can occur in any age group, often in close-quarter living situations.

## Highlights

- A significant decline in meningococcal meningitis cases and deaths has been observed over the observed period, from 2010 to October 2023. <br/>
- The data shows seasonal variability, with higher case numbers in the cooler months (January to April) and a drop during the warmer months (May to August). <br/>
- There was an unusually low number of cases and no deaths reported in October 2023, indicating effective disease control or underreporting. <br/>
- The overall case-fatality ratio has reduced over time, suggesting improvements in healthcare access, disease surveillance, and possibly vaccination campaigns. <br/>

An evaluation of Meningococcal meningitis in mainland China from 2010 through October 2023 reveals a fluctuating yet decreasing trend in the number of reported cases. Initially, peaking during early months, with 68 cases in March 2010, cases gradually subside, reaching single digits regularly by 2021. The data indicates an overall reduction in cases over the years with sporadic increases. Notably, there is a sharp decline post-2020, concordant with the COVID-19 pandemic onset, where drastic public health measures may have inadvertently impacted the transmission of other infectious diseases.

Analysing mortality associated with Meningococcal meningitis from 2010 to October 2023 exhibits a declining trend in deaths, with mortality spikes in 2010 March (7 deaths) and a notable 6 deaths in December 2017. The majority of data points post-2010 indicate zero to three deaths per month. This decrease in fatalities may suggest improved clinical interventions, increased vaccination coverage, or better reporting practices. After 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, reported deaths are minimal, potentially influenced by enhanced infection control measures and altered healthcare-seeking behavior.

# Mumps 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns:

Based on the provided data, a clear seasonal pattern emerges regarding the incidence of mumps cases in mainland China. The number of cases reaches its peak during the spring and summer months (March to August), specifically in May and June. Subsequently, there is a gradual decline in cases during the fall and winter months (September to February), with December and January representing the lowest point. This consistent pattern spans across multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods:

Typically, mainland China experiences a peak in mumps cases during May and June, when the highest number of cases is reported. On the other hand, the trough period occurs in December and January, which witnesses the fewest number of cases. It is important to acknowledge that the precise timing of these peak and trough periods may vary slightly from year to year, but the overall pattern remains constant.

Overall Trends:

When considering the overall trends, there is a general upward trajectory in the number of mumps cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2016, with the highest number of cases occurring in 2016. Starting from that year, there is a gradual decrease in the number of cases, albeit with some fluctuations. Nonetheless, the overall trend is downward. However, it is crucial to note that the data for 2023 is only available until October, preventing a determination of the overall trend for that particular year based on the provided data.

Discussion:

The observed seasonal patterns in the data indicate that mumps transmission in mainland China is influenced by environmental factors and human behavior, which vary throughout the year. The peak in cases during the spring and summer months may be attributed to increased social interactions and close contact, such as during school or summer vacation periods. Conversely, the decline in cases during the fall and winter months may be attributed to reduced social interactions and increased awareness of preventive measures, such as vaccination.

The overall trend of decreasing mumps cases in mainland China from 2016 onwards is promising and potentially indicative of successful public health interventions, including vaccination campaigns and improved hygiene practices. However, it is essential to maintain vigilance and high vaccination coverage to prevent any potential resurgence of mumps cases.

It is noteworthy that the provided data includes negative values for certain months, particularly in the early years. These negative values may result from data reporting issues or inconsistencies and should be interpreted with caution.
## Introduction

Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection characterized by the painful swelling of the salivary glands, typically the parotid glands located near the ears. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness, and difficulty with swallowing. Additional symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Mumps spreads through saliva or respiratory droplets from an infected person. It's primarily known for affecting children, but can occur at any age. Vaccination, specifically the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, is the best prevention against mumps.

## Highlights

- A significant decline in mumps cases in mainland China is observed from the peak years of 2010-2012 to October 2023. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, there is an overall downward trend in mumps cases from tens of thousands per month during 2010-2012 to fewer than 10,000 cases per month in 2023. <br/>
- Mumps-related mortality is minimal and sporadic throughout the years with zero deaths reported most months since 2020. <br/>
- The current disease situation as of October 2023, with 8,287 cases and no deaths, suggests that mumps is under control in mainland China. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to October 2023, mainland China reported a fluctuating pattern in mumps cases with seasonal peaks typically occurring between April and July each year. Despite seasonal fluctuations, there was a notable decrease in reported cases beginning in 2020, which persisted into the following years. This trend may be attributed to various factors, including public health interventions and changes in surveillance or reporting. Notably, the sharpest decline is observed in 2020, which coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly reflects the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masks and social distancing.

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, reported mumps-related deaths were extremely low compared to the number of cases, highlighting the non-lethal nature of the disease when managed properly. Occasional fatalities did occur, with a total of 16 deaths recorded from 2010 to 2023—a minute fraction of the total case count. The highest number of deaths in a single month was four, which occurred in January 2020. This anomaly underscores the necessity for continued vigilance in mumps management, even though the disease is generally not associated with high mortality rates.

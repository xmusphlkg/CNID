# Mumps 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Mumps is a viral illness primarily affecting the salivary glands, causing painful swelling. Transmissible through respiratory droplets, it commonly manifests in children. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite, and often become evident 16-18 days post exposure. Vaccination via MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) is the primary prevention method, with initial innoculation recommended at 12–15 months of age, and a second dose at 4–6 years of age. Complications can include meningitis, orchitis, and rare cases of deafness or infertility.
## Highlights

- A consistent seasonal pattern is observed, with significantly higher mumps case numbers around May and June each year, possibly due to increased social interactions during these months. <br/>
- There was a marked decrease in the number of cases starting from 2020, likely due to public health interventions against COVID-19 (e.g., social distancing, mask-wearing) also impacting mumps transmission. <br/>
- The mortality associated with mumps has remained very low throughout the years, suggesting effective clinical management and possibly high vaccination coverage. <br/>
- As of November 2023, the number of mumps cases has declined further, indicating ongoing control of mumps transmission within the Chinese mainland population.

From 2010 through 2023, mainland China experienced seasonal fluctuations in mumps cases. Peaks often occurred in June, with a noticeable high in 2012 at 71,606 cases. Starting from 2020, there was a significant decline in cases, most notably during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may reflect the impact of public health measures. Despite the seasonality and yearly variations, the number of cases began to decrease steadily from 2020 onwards, indicating a potential improvement in disease control and prevention efforts.

Mumps-associated mortality in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 remained exceedingly low, with a total of 15 deaths recorded over 14 years. The data show sporadic fatalities, with no distinguishable pattern or trend in the number of deaths each year. The highest number of deaths in a single month was four, occurring in January 2020. Overall, the mortality rate for mumps is minimal, suggesting effective clinical management and the non-lethal nature of the disease. The data point toward mumps being a controlled illness in terms of mortality risk within the Chinese mainland.

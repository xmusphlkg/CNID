# Mumps

Version: November 2023

## Introduction

Mumps is a contagious viral disease characterized by fever, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, and swelling of the salivary glands, notably the parotid glands. It primarily affects unvaccinated individuals and can spread through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Mumps was common globally until the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine greatly reduced its prevalence. In rare cases, serious complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, and deafness can occur. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure against mumps.

## Highlights

1. Drastic Drop in Cases: Since the peak in 2012, Mumps cases have seen a steady decline, most notably after 2019. The drop from 27,704 cases in November 2019 to 7642 in November 2023 represents a substantial decrease over time. <br/>
2. Low Fatality: Across the years, Mumps has a low fatality rate with only sporadic death events, demonstrating the typically non-lethal nature of the disease. <br/>
3. Seasonal Trends: There is a clear cyclical annual pattern with cases typically showing a peak during May-June and again lower numbers in the latter part of the year, indicating a strong seasonal influence on the disease occurrence. <br/>
4. Rapid decrease in 2020: Cases plummeted drastically from January 2020 onwards, potentially reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in reporting, or other unknown factors.

The overall trend of mumps cases in Chinese mainland is mixed, with clear cyclical patterns and spikes, mostly recurring around May to June each year. The highest reported number of cases was in 2012 with a peak of 71,606 cases in June, which suggests a seasonal pattern. It's also of note that there's a gradual reduction in the reported cases from 2010, possibly due to effective vaccination programs or herd immunity - with slight exceptions in 2018 and 2019. The trend further decreases in the most recent years, possibly also impacted by coronavirus pandemic measures restraining the mumps spread.

Analysis of the death data shows that fatalities due to mumps in Chinese mainland are extremely rare despite the high incidence of cases. With only occasional occurrences, the total recorded number of deaths throughout these years remain exceedingly low with the highest in January 2020 (4 deaths). This rare mortality indicates effective clinical management of the disease and potentially high vaccination coverage. The absence of deaths in many months, even with high case count, points to the generally non-lethal nature of mumps and effective public health measures.

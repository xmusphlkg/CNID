# Mumps 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the mumps virus, a member of the paramyxovirus family. It's primarily characterized by the painful swelling of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, located near the ears, which can result in a distinctive "chipmunk cheek" appearance. Other symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Mumps is typically transmitted through respiratory secretions or saliva. Since the introduction of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, occurrences have dramatically decreased, though outbreaks still happen, particularly in areas with low vaccination coverage.

## Highlights

- Mumps cases have seen a sharp decline in mainland China from the beginning of the decade (2010) till September 2023. The highest number of cases were seen in June 2012 (71606 cases), which was drastically reduced to 10867 cases in September 2023. <br/>
- The months of May, June and July appear to be peak months for the mumps seasonal trend in cases across the years, with June often reporting the highest number of cases. <br/>
- Despite a high number of reported cases, mumps mortality is exceedingly low. There's a notable peak in 2020 with 5 deaths, but usually there are only 0-2 reported deaths annually. <br/>
- Current disease situation as of September 2023 is under control with 10867 cases and no deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Mumps cases in mainland China show a clear cyclical pattern each year with peaks normally around May-June and lows around February. The highest number of cases was reported in June 2012 (71,606 cases), and the lowest in February 2022 (4,491 cases). From 2010 to 2022, an upward trend in the number of cases is noticeable with a peak in 2012 followed by a general downward trend through 2023. However, it's important to note data may not yet be complete for 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
Mumps-related deaths in mainland China are extremely low relative to the number of reported cases. Between 2010 and 2023, there were a total of only 14 recorded deaths attributable to mumps. The highest number of deaths in a single month (4) was reported in January 2020. Unlike case numbers, there does not appear to be a pronounced seasonal pattern for deaths. It's crucial to remember though, while deaths from mumps are rare, complications can occur, leading to severe health issues.

# Other hepatitis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to the inflammation of the liver caused by infectious agents other than the five known hepatitis viruses, A to E. This condition can result from exposures to certain drugs, toxins, heavy alcohol use, and some autoimmune diseases. It also includes rare types of viral hepatitis such as hepatitis caused by herpesviruses, adenoviruses, or cytomegalovirus. The symptoms are similar to viral hepatitis but may vary based on etiology. The impact and outcome range from mild and self-limiting conditions to severe liver damage, which can be acute or chronic.
## Highlights

- Significant decrease in Other hepatitis cases from 2010 to 2023, with initial highs (5,010 in March 2011) to a low of 347 in December 2022. <br/>
- Reduction in mortality, with deaths dwindling from occasional peaks (6 in December 2012) to zero in November 2023. <br/>
- Consistent downward trend in annual case numbers with no recent peaks nearing early-decade figures. <br/>
- Notable case drop in early 2020, potentially due to COVID-19 public health measures, with no rebound to pre-2020 levels by November 2023. <br/>

Between January 2010 and November 2023, Chinese mainland reported a general downward trend in cases of Other hepatitis, decreasing from 3723 cases to a low of 347 cases in December 2022. A seasonal pattern is not prominently observable. However, there were apparent spikes, notably in March annually, with fluctuations throughout the years. The highest peak occurred in March 2011 with 5010 cases, whereas the lowest counts were reported at the end of 2022. The data for January and February 2013 are missing, interrupting the trend analysis for that period.

The death count associated with Other hepatitis in the 2010-2023 time frame shows overall low mortality, with monthly deaths rarely exceeding five. There is no clear trend or significant increase in deaths over time, indicating steady case fatality rates. The highest number of deaths in a single month was 6 in December 2012. Deaths dropped to zero on multiple occasions, particularly noticeable from 2018 onwards, with few exceptions where deaths were reported. This suggests improved management or reporting of Other hepatitis, or both. Data are missing for the entirety of January and February 2013, creating a gap in the continuity.

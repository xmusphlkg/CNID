# Other hepatitis 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to liver inflammation caused by factors other than the commonly known hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses. It can result from infections, autoimmune diseases, medications, toxins, alcohol, and other less common viruses. These types of hepatitis are less prevalent but can still lead to significant health issues, including chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Diagnosis often requires a combination of blood tests, imaging, and sometimes liver biopsy, with treatments varying based on the underlying cause. Preventive measures and strategies depend on the specific etiology of the hepatitis.

## Highlights

- A downward trend of Other hepatitis cases is observed in mainland China from 2010 to 2023, with cases decreasing from above 4000 each month in 2010 to less than 1000 each month in 2023. <br/>
- The fatality rate of hepatitis has mostly remained low throughout these years, typically ranging from 0 to 6 deaths regardless of the higher number of cases in early years.<br/>
- A noticeable drop in cases is observed in February 2020, which could likely be linked to the strain that COVID-19 pandemic put on the healthcare system and reporting/measuring other diseases. <br/>
- The data shows no significant seasonal pattern in the occurrence of hepatitis cases over the years, indicating the disease tends to spread in a consistent pattern throughout all months.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data for Other Hepatitis over a span of approximately 14 years (2010-2023) in mainland China shows a consistent, downward trend. A sharp spike can be observed annually around March, which might correspond with Chinese New Year activities. However, the general trend indicates substantial progress in disease control, with reported cases reducing from over 4,000 per month in the initial years (2010-2012) to under 1,000 per month in recent years (2021-2023).

### Deaths Analysis
The fatality rate, despite the variation in the number of reported cases, has remained relatively low over the studied period, with an average of 1 death per month. A few outliers are noted, such as December 2012, November 2013, and December 2019, with 6, 4, and 2 deaths respectively. However, from 2020 onwards, the death rate becomes more infrequent and sporadic, reflecting potentially improved health care services and better hepatitis management.

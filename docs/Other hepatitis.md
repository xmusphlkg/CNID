# Other hepatitis 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns:

Based on the provided data, a clear seasonal pattern in the incidence of Other hepatitis cases in mainland China is evident. The number of cases tends to be higher during the winter months (December to February) and lower during the summer months (June to August). This consistent pattern is observed throughout the years.

Peak and Trough Periods:

Peak periods for Other hepatitis cases in mainland China predominantly occur in the winter months, specifically in January and February. Case numbers during these months consistently surpass those of other months. Conversely, trough periods, characterized by the lowest case numbers, are observed in the summer months, particularly in July and August. These months consistently have the fewest cases in comparison to other months.

Overall Trends:

There has been a noticeable downtrend in the incidence of Other hepatitis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. Although case numbers were relatively high in the earlier years (2010-2012), they gradually decreased over time. However, there was a slight increase in cases in 2013 and 2014, followed by a subsequent decline in the later years. The lowest number of cases was recorded in 2020, but a slight increase has been observed in recent years (2021-2023).

Discussion:

The observed seasonal pattern of Other hepatitis cases in mainland China, with higher numbers during winter and lower numbers during summer, raises the possibility of an association with climatic factors or behavioral patterns. It is essential to further investigate the underlying reasons for this pattern, as it may provide valuable insights into the disease's transmission dynamics.

The overall decreasing trend in case numbers over the years indicates commendable efforts in disease prevention and control. However, the slight recent increase in cases emphasizes the continuing need for surveillance and interventions to prevent the resurgence of Other hepatitis in mainland China.

It is important to note that the data for January and February 2013 includes negative values for cases and deaths. This discrepancy may be attributed to errors in data reporting or recording, and should be verified and rectified if necessary.

In conclusion, the provided data demonstrates a well-defined seasonal pattern, with peak periods during winter months and trough periods during summer months, for Other hepatitis cases in mainland China. There is an overall decreasing trend in case numbers over the years, although a slight increase has been observed recently. Further investigation and sustained efforts in disease prevention and control are crucial to address this significant public health issue.
## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to the various, less common forms of liver inflammation not caused by the primary hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E. These can result from infections by other pathogens, toxic substances, alcohol abuse, autoimmune diseases, or medications. Symptoms often mirror those of viral hepatitis, including jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical evaluation, liver function tests, and sometimes more specific testing to identify the underlying cause. Treatment varies depending on the etiology and can range from medication to lifestyle changes or supportive care.

## Highlights

- Significant decrease in reported cases of other hepatitis from 2010 (3723 cases in January) to 2023 (644 cases in October). <br/>
- Mortality associated with other hepatitis has remained low, with many months reporting zero deaths in recent years, indicating potentially effective management strategies since 2010. <br/>
- No mortality reported since February 2023 up to the current data point in October 2023, which suggests an improvement in disease outcomes or reporting accuracy. <br/>
- The overall trend indicates a reduction in both incidence and mortality rates for other hepatitis in mainland China over the 13-year span. <br/>

From 2010 to 2023, reported cases of Other hepatitis in mainland China demonstrated a decline from 3723 cases in January 2010 to 644 cases in October 2023. A noticeable drop occurred in February 2020, possibly due to health resource allocation amid the COVID-19 pandemic and associated control measures such as lockdowns. Seasonal variations appear minimal, suggesting a stable transmission pattern across seasons. The consistent downtrend suggests potential improvements in public health interventions, vaccination, and hygiene practices.

Over the same period, deaths associated with Other hepatitis in mainland China have remained low, with a peak of 6 deaths in December 2012. Following this peak, mortality rates have generally decreased or remained stable at zero to one deaths per month, despite fluctuating case numbers. The highest mortality was observed in the early years (2010–2012), with a subsequent reduction likely due to enhanced health care interventions, disease awareness, and possibly improved reporting accuracy. The mortality data supports the conclusion of effective management of hepatitis in China.

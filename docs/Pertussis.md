# Pertussis 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: 
Analysis of the data reveals a distinct seasonal pattern for Pertussis cases in mainland China. The incidence tends to be higher during the summer and fall months, specifically from June to October. Throughout this period, the number of cases gradually increases, reaching its peak in either August or September, before subsequently declining towards the end of the year. In contrast, the winter and spring months, spanning from November to May, generally exhibit lower case counts.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Pertussis cases in mainland China predominantly occurs in August and September. During these months, the number of cases reaches its highest point, with values occasionally surpassing 4000 in certain years. Conversely, the trough period usually takes place during the winter and spring months, from November to May, when the number of cases is at its lowest, often falling below 500.

Overall Trends: 
Overall, there is an upward trend in Pertussis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. The number of cases demonstrates a gradual increase throughout this period, with some year-to-year fluctuations. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant decrease in cases observed in 2020, which can likely be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures.

Discussion: 
The seasonal pattern of Pertussis cases in mainland China suggests a higher prevalence of the disease during the summer and fall months, aligning with the known transmission dynamics of Pertussis. The peak occurring in August and September may be influenced by factors such as heightened social interactions, travel, and gatherings during the summer vacation period. Additionally, the lower case counts observed during the winter and spring months may be attributed to reduced transmission and heightened awareness of respiratory hygiene practices during colder weather.

The overall increasing trend in Pertussis cases over the years underscores the necessity for ongoing surveillance and preventive measures. Vaccination against Pertussis serves as an effective strategy for disease control, thereby warranting efforts to ensure high vaccination coverage, particularly among infants and young children who are most susceptible to severe complications. Furthermore, raising awareness about Pertussis symptoms, early diagnosis, and appropriate treatment can contribute to alleviating the burden of the disease.

It is noteworthy that the data pertaining to deaths associated with Pertussis is relatively low, with most months reporting zero deaths. However, there are sporadic occurrences of deaths reported throughout the years, underscoring the significance of timely diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and supportive care for individuals affected by Pertussis.

In sum, this analysis provides valuable insights into the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends of Pertussis cases in mainland China. Continuous monitoring and implementation of preventive measures are pivotal in mitigating the impact of Pertussis and safeguarding public health.
## Introduction

Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After fits of coughing, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breaths which result in a "whooping" sound. Pertussis can affect individuals of any age but is most severe for babies. The best prevention measure is vaccination with the DTaP vaccine for children and Tdap booster for older children, adults, and especially pregnant women.

## Highlights

- Steady increase in pertussis cases observed since 2010, reflecting escalating transmission or improved case detection across mainland China. <br/>
- Deaths remain infrequent despite rising case numbers, indicating enhanced healthcare response or lower virulence. <br/>
- Significant surge in cases from July to October 2023 suggests possible outbreak or reporting anomaly, requiring urgent public health investigation. <br/>
- The persistence of cases despite vaccination efforts points toward gaps in herd immunity or vaccine coverage, warranting review of immunization strategies. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The pertussis case data from mainland China indicates a notable increasing trend from 2010 to 2023. Beginning with relatively fewer cases (88 in January 2010), there is a rise peaking in August each year, likely due to seasonal influences. The data also divulges a substantial escalation over the years, specifically from 2017 onwards, with a significant surge in 2023, showing the highest reported cases (4793 in August). This upward trajectory might be due to various factors, including improved diagnosis, reporting practices, or diminished vaccine efficacy over time.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths associated with pertussis in mainland China, as per the available data, is relatively low compared to the cases reported. From 2010 to 2023, the total deaths recorded in a month rarely exceeds one, indicating a low case-fatality rate. However, this low mortality could be attributed to effective clinical management and vaccination coverage. It's noteworthy that despite increasing cases, the number of deaths has not shown a parallel rise, suggesting that pertussis, while highly infectious, is being managed in a way that minimizes fatalities.

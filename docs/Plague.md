# Plague 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Plague is a severe, often fatal bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis, primarily transmitted through flea bites and contact with infected animals. Historically responsible for outbreaks like the Black Death, it predominantly affects rodents, but can jump to humans. Symptoms typically include fever, weakness, and swollen lymph nodes (buboes). There are three forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, each related to the infection's location in the body. Though significantly less common today, plague cases do occur, generally in rural and semi-rural regions. Prompt treatment with antibiotics can prevent complications and death.
## Highlights

1. Plague incidence in mainland China is generally very low, with sporadic cases reported mostly in summer and autumn.<br/>
2. A relative increase in cases and mortality has been observed in August 2023, hinting at a possible emerging outbreak.<br/>
3. Year 2019 recorded a higher incidence with 4 cases in November, but there were no reported deaths.<br/>
4. Overall, mortality seems to be diminishing over time, suggesting improvements in response capacity and health infrastructure.<br/>

The sporadic pattern of Plague cases across mainland China indicates its relative containment across the observed years. The disease recurs annually, typically registering single-digit cases, predominantly in the warmer periods. The largest reported surge occurred in 2023 August (4 cases), perhaps reflective of rare environmental or sociobehavioral factors.

The death data correlates with the case data, further emphasizing the sporadic and generally controlled nature of Plague in mainland China. Deaths occur predominantly within the same months as case surges. The case-fatality rate seems significant, as evidenced in years 2010 (1/2), 2012 (1/1), 2014 (3/3), 2017 (1/1), 2019 (1/5), 2020 (3/4) and 2023 (1/5), indicating an urgent need to strengthen clinical handling and disease response strategies.

# Plague 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Plague is a severe and often deadly bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis. It's zoonotic, primarily affecting rodents and is spread to humans through bites of infected fleas. Historically, it has caused devastating pandemics such as the Black Death in the Middle Ages. There are three forms of plague - bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, each varying in symptoms, routes of exposure, and severity. Modern antibiotics are effective treatments, but a delay in treatment can lead to severe illness or death. It is less common today but remains a concern in certain regions.
## Highlights

- Plague in mainland China shows sporadic occurrences with infrequent cases reported annually. A slight uptick in cases was observed in 2019 and 2020 but numbers remain generally low. <br/>
- Since 2010, a total of 20 cases and 11 deaths have been recorded, indicating a relatively high case-fatality ratio. Notably, cases can be fatal if not treated promptly. <br/>
- The most recent data from November 2023 reports 1 case with no associated deaths, suggesting an isolated incident or early detection and treatment. <br/>
- Periodic clusters appear without a clear seasonal pattern, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and readiness to respond to potential outbreaks. <br/>

Between January 2010 and November 2023, sporadic cases of plague in the Chinese mainland were recorded, with a total of 22 instances. The occurrence of cases was irregular and infrequent throughout the years. Most years reported zero to one case, with occasional minor outbreaks, such as in November 2019 with 4 cases, and August 2023 with 4 cases, which represented the highest number of cases in any given month throughout the period analyzed. No discernible seasonal pattern is evident, and the overall incidence remains low.

The reported data indicate a total of 13 deaths from plague in the Chinese mainland during the same period. Mortality associated with reported cases occurred inconsistently, with several instances of single mortalities following a reported case, suggesting a high case-fatality rate during certain outbreaks. Two months, October 2014 and August 2020, saw all reported cases result in death. The data does not show a clear correlation between the number of cases and resultant deaths, indicative of small sample sizes or varied virulence and access to treatment.

# Poliomyelitis 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: According to the provided data, no clear seasonal pattern can be observed for cases and deaths related to Poliomyelitis in mainland China prior to October 2023. The number of cases and deaths have consistently remained low over the years, with no noticeable fluctuations or identifiable seasonal peaks.

Peak and Trough Periods: As previously mentioned, there are no distinct periods of high or low points evident in the data. The number of cases and deaths has consistently remained low, without any significant increases or decreases observed over time.

Overall Trends: The overall trend for cases and deaths related to Poliomyelitis in mainland China before October 2023 is characterized by consistently low numbers. There is no significant upward or downward trend evident in the data.

Discussion: The absence of Poliomyelitis cases and deaths in mainland China before October 2023 indicates successful control and prevention measures implemented by public health authorities. The consistently low numbers suggest that the disease has been effectively managed, possibly through vaccination programs and other public health interventions. However, it is crucial to continue monitoring and surveillance efforts to ensure that the disease remains under control and to prevent any potential outbreaks in the future.
## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is a highly infectious viral disease caused by the poliovirus. Primarily affecting children under the age of five, the virus spreads from person to person, predominantly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food). Once it enters the body, the virus multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. While there is no cure for polio, it can be prevented by immunization with a polio vaccine. Polio cases have diminished significantly due to global vaccination efforts.

## Highlights

- No cases or deaths due to Poliomyelitis reported from January 2010 to July 2011, suggesting successful control or elimination efforts. <br/>
- An outbreak occurred in August 2011, with a total of 20 cases and 1 death reported through December 2011, indicating a temporary lapse in polio-free status. <br/>
- Subsequent to the 2011 outbreak, no further cases or deaths have been reported from January 2012 to October 2023, demonstrating the effectiveness of response measures and immunization campaigns. <br/>
- As of October 2023, mainland China appears to have maintained its polio-free status for over a decade, assuming no unreported cases exist, showing a strong public health system and vaccine coverage. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From January 2010 to October 2023, mainland China reported poliomyelitis cases only between August 2011 and December 2011, with a total of 20 cases. The outbreak peaked in October with 8 cases. The absence of cases in the remaining years suggests effective polio surveillance and vaccination programs, contributing to the interruption of virus transmission and maintaining polio-free status in subsequent years, as per World Health Organization (WHO) standards.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths due to poliomyelitis in mainland China during the same period occurred only in September 2011, with 1 death out of the 6 reported cases. The low mortality rate (5% of the cases that year) and its restriction to a single month indicate rapid containment and response measures were effective. Continuing polio-free, as evidenced by zero reported deaths since then, reflects the strength of China's public health interventions in preventing and controlling vaccine-preventable diseases.

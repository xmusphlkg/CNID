# Poliomyelitis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, often called polio, is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children. The virus is transmitted person-to-person, typically through contaminated water or food, and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system. Many infected people show no symptoms, but for some, the disease can lead to paralysis and occasionally death. There's no cure for polio, it can only be prevented through immunization. The World Health Organization is spearheading efforts to eradicate polio worldwide.
## Highlights

- Sustained zero case status: Since the initial reported outbreak in 2011, Chinese mainland has maintained a record of zero poliomyelitis cases since January 2012, indicating effective disease control and eradication efforts. <br/>
- Successful response to outbreak: The data highlight a brief outbreak in 2011 with a total of 20 cases and 1 death. However, prompt public health interventions seem to have been successful in halting further spread. <br/>
- Poliomyelitis eradication appears sustained: The consistently reported zero cases from 2012 through to November 2023 suggests that poliomyelitis is no longer endemic in the Chinese mainland. <br/>
- Continued vigilance needed: Despite the absence of new cases, continuous surveillance and vaccination campaigns are crucial to ensure the virus does not re-emerge, particularly in the context of global travel and migration. <br/>

Poliomyelitis showed a zero-case incidence in the Chinese mainland for the majority of the observed period (2010 January - 2023 November), with a brief spike observed in 2011 August-December, totaling 20 cases. This transient rise represents an anomaly in an otherwise consistent pattern of no cases reported. Following this period, there have been no cases from 2012 January onward to 2023 November. The year 2011 stands as a critical exception in the epidemiology of Poliomyelitis in this dataset, indicating a short-lived outbreak that was controlled and contained effectively.

The death analysis from the provided data shows one fatality recorded in September 2011 in the midst of the brief polio outbreak. This sole death within a timeframe spanning nearly fourteen years underlines the significant progress China has made in Poliomyelitis control and prevention. Post-September 2011, no further deaths were recorded, aligning with the absence of poliovirus cases. This indicates highly effective immunization strategies, rapid outbreak response, and a sustained commitment to maintaining a polio-free status in the Chinese mainland.

# Rabies 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Rabies is a viral disease of mammals most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. It's caused by a lyssavirus that affects the central nervous system, leading to disease in the brain and death. The rabies virus is usually spread through the saliva of an infected animal. Once symptoms appear, rabies is nearly always fatal. Initial symptoms can be flu-like, which progress to neurological problems such as aggressive behavior, hallucinations, and paralysis. Vaccination after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) is highly effective. In regions with rabies in wildlife, pet vaccination programs and control of stray animals are essential prevention measures.

- A steady decrease in both reported Rabies cases and deaths observed in mainland China, from high numbers in 2010 to consistently low figures in 2023. <br/>
- There is a clear seasonality pattern with peaks during the summer months, particularly evident in the years 2010 and 2011. <br/>
- The case fatality rate remains notably high, with the number of deaths closely mirroring the number of cases each month up through 2023. <br/>
- As of September 2023, both cases and deaths are relatively low, with 8 cases and 7 deaths reported.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reveals a downward trend in the number of reported rabies cases in mainland China from 2010 through 2023. The peak was recorded in September 2010 with 233 cases, while the lowest was 5 in January 2023. A seasonal pattern is also notable, with spikes occurring in the summer and decreases in the winter. The number of cases drastically reduced after 2014, and the rate of reduction became less steep after 2017, indicating some degree of control over the spread of the disease.

### Deaths Analysis
A similar decreasing trend can be observed in the number of deaths due to rabies from 2010 to 2023. The highest number of deaths was 208 in November 2010 and the lowest was 4 recorded in February 2022 and 2023. The correlation between the number of cases and deaths remains relatively high implying a high case-fatality rate. From 2018 onwards, however, the gap between cases and deaths appears to widen slightly, indicating potential improvements in survival rates possibly due to advancements in treatment or early detection.

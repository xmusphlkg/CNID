# Rubella 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German Measles, is a viral illness affecting the skin and lymph nodes. The disease typically manifests as a mild rash and fever, often mistaken for flu. Infection during pregnancy can lead to serious complications such as Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) causing multiple birth defects. The rubella virus is airborne, transmitted through respiratory droplets. Immunization through the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine has significantly reduced rubella cases globally. However, the virus remains endemic in regions where immunization coverage is low.
## Highlights

- A significant decline in Rubella cases in Chinese mainland is observed, from peaks of over 18,000 cases in 2011 to consistently lower numbers below 200 monthly from 2018 to 2023. <br/>
- Mortality from Rubella is minimal, with only a few deaths reported over 13 years, signifying effective treatment and likely high population immunity. <br/>
- Cases have been in double or single digits since 2020, possibly due to better vaccination programs or COVID-19 overshadowing Rubella reporting. <br/>
- Data up to November 2023 shows a well-controlled Rubella situation, with low case counts and zero deaths.

The Rubella cases in Chinese mainland exhibited periodic fluctuations over the years, with notable peaks observed during April and May from 2010 to 2019, potentially indicating seasonal patterns. A significant drop in cases began in 2020, persisting through 2023, which might be ascribed to improved vaccination efforts, heightened public health measures, or underreporting due to overlapping pandemic concerns. The decline to consistently low case numbers by 2021 suggests effective control, potentially also influenced by COVID-19 related restrictions impacting disease transmission dynamics.

Throughout the observed period, Rubella-related deaths in Chinese mainland were extremely rare, totaling only 4 documented fatalities over 13 years. The deaths sporadically occurred in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, and 2022. Given the generally benign nature of Rubella and the low fatality rate, these deaths could be attributed to complications in vulnerable populations. The consistent low mortality rate underscores the non-severe nature of the disease and could reflect both the efficacy of healthcare interventions and the vaccination coverage among the population.

# Schistosomiasis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia or "snail fever," is a parasitic disease caused by blood fluke parasites of the genus Schistosoma. People contract it from freshwater bodies contaminated with infected snails. Globally, over 200 million people are estimated to be at risk, with the disease prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. The disease manifests as an acute or chronic infection, presenting symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in stool or urine, and can lead to organ damage if untreated.


## Highlights

1. Substantial Decrease in Cases: There has been a dramatic decrease in Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China from thousands per month in 2015, to a consistent single digit counts since 2020.<br/>
2. Notable Outbreaks: Prominent outbreaks were observed in 2015 with peak cases reaching over 10,000 in November. After 2015, similar outbreaks diminished both in frequency and magnitude.<br/>
3. Low Case Fatality Rate: Mortality due to Schistosomiasis has been extremely low throughout the analysed period, with only a handful of deaths reported in total.<br/>
4. Current Situation: As of November 2023, Schistosomiasis remains controlled, with just 3 cases and no deaths reported, a clear manifestation of successful disease control policies.Phase.<br/>

The reported data for Schistosomiasis in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 shows a fluctuating but overall diminishing trend in the numbers of cases. Significant peaks of cases were observed in November 2015 and October 2016, relating to nearly 10,000 and around 2,000 cases respectively. From 2017 onwards, the number of reported cases drastically reduced, indicating a significant improvement in scoliosis control and prevention efforts. By late 2021, the number of reported cases steadily averaged into single digits. However, a minor increase is noted in May 2022 but has since receded.

Contrary to the cases reported, the numbers of deaths due to Schistosomiasis over the same period is scarce, peaking at merely 3 cases in June 2012. Deaths remain relatively sporadic and rare across the entire period, with numerous months reporting zero deaths. This might suggest an overall effective medical response in managing the condition, given the high case count relative to the significantly lower death rates. This is compounded by the fact that from 2014 until 2023, death occurrence due to Schistosomiasis has been virtually non-existent in mainland China.

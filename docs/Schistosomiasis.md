# Schistosomiasis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by flatworms called schistosomes. It is transmitted when people come into contact with freshwater contaminated with the parasites. The infection can lead to chronic illness, causing damage to the liver, intestine, spleen, lungs, and bladder. According to the World Health Organization, schistosomiasis affects almost 240 million people worldwide, predominantly in poor communities without safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.
## Highlights

- Dramatic reduction in cases and deaths: Since the peak in November 2015, there has been a substantial decline in schistosomiasis cases and associated mortality in mainland China, indicating successful control measures. <br/>
- Sporadic resurgence observed: Despite overall success, sporadic increases in cases, such as those in September 2017 and December 2018, suggest the continued risk of outbreaks and the need for vigilant surveillance. <br/>
- Sustained low-level transmission: Since 2019, the number of reported cases has been consistently low, with very few deaths, suggesting that transmission has been significantly reduced but not completely eliminated. <br/>
- Ongoing control efforts required: The persistence of low-level cases up to November 2023 underscores the importance of continuous control efforts, including snail control, improved sanitation, health education, and access to clean water. <br/>

The data from 2010 to 2023 show variable incidence of schistosomiasis cases across the years on Chinese mainland. A surge in cases is observed in 2015, with monthly cases reaching up to 10,481 in November, after which a dramatic decline occurs. Fluctuations in the number of cases are evident, but a significant drop is noticeable from 2017, consistent with enhanced control measures. By 2018, reported cases consistently remain low, annually ranging from single to low triple digits. The recent trend from 2020 to 2023 indicates minimal occurrence, demonstrating sustained control efforts and interruption of transmission in previously endemic areas.

Schistosomiasis-associated mortality from 2010 to 2023 remains remarkably low, with deaths sporadically reported and totaling six cases in twelve years. No deaths were reported in most years, and the maximum annual death toll observed was three in 2012. The data suggest effective clinical management and disease control, contributing to an extremely low fatality rate. Years with reported fatalities, like 2012 and 2020, indicate that while the disease is predominantly controlled, occasional lethal outcomes still occur, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and health system readiness.

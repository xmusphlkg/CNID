# Syphilis 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It presents in stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. The initial symptom is typically a painless sore or chancre at the infection site. Secondary syphilis may manifest as rashes or mucocutaneous lesions. Untreated, it can enter a latent phase, asymptomatic for years. Tertiary syphilis may occur decades later, damaging the heart, brain, and other organs. Diagnosis is through blood tests or examination of lesion exudates, and treatment is usually with penicillin. Preventive measures include safe sex practices and regular screenings.

## Highlights

1. A steady increase in the number of syphilis cases has been observed in China over the past decade, with a noticeable rage of 20,000 to 61,000 per month. <br/>
2. The number of deaths due to syphilis has been relatively low and has only ranged approximately between 0 and 25 deaths per month. <br/>
3. Monthly cases seem to often peak around mid-year, especially in the month of July. Recent data from 2023 indicates a high of 61,068 cases in August. <br/>
4. A significant reduction in cases is noticed during winter periods, evidencing seasonality. Notably, December 2022 has the lowest reported number of cases with 24,367 cases. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data on Syphilis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 shows a general increasing trend in the recorded cases annually. While fluctuating monthly, the overall cases have been rising each year. The highest number of reported cases occurs in August 2023 with 61068 cases. It is significant to note that some month's data are missing, which may somewhat distort the overall picture. Patterns of increasing cases during certain months, particularly the summer months, suggests a possible seasonal influence on the transmission of Syphilis.

### Deaths Analysis
The death rate, in contrast to the number of Syphilis cases, does not follow a consistent upward trend over the years. The recorded deaths remain relatively low compared to the number of cases, with the highest number recorded in January 2020 as 25 deaths. The relatively low death rate indicates that while the disease seems to be prevalent, its fatal consequences are less frequent. Further analysis has to be made to see if this is an indication of successful health measures or due to underreporting of deaths.

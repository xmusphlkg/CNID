> **CNIDS: Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project**
> CNIDS is a project aimed at monitoring notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland. The project utilizes automated technology and data analysis methods to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities for infectious diseases, enabling timely measures to be taken to address potential public health risks.
> The primary objective of the CNIDS project is to establish an efficient infectious disease Surveillance system that enables real-time surveillance of legally notifiable infectious diseases and internet news. It provides decision-makers with timely information and recommendations to facilitate appropriate measures for disease control and prevention.

# Introduction

## Overview

As we review the reported cases and corresponding deaths from various diseases across Chinese mainland in November 2023, we observe a significant emphasis on respiratory and vector-borne diseases, attributable to the seasonal patterns and other contributing factors. The data showcases a considerable number of cases across a wide array of diseases, with notable figures in diseases such as Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (153,086 cases), and Infectious Diarrhea (108,329 cases). However, it is worth mentioning the notably high case count for Hepatitis, with Hepatitis B leading (96,336 cases), followed by Hepatitis C (20,245 cases), Hepatitis A (1,367 cases), and lesser counts for Hepatitis E and Hepatitis D. The mortality data reflects a concerning number of deaths associated with Tuberculosis (214 deaths), highlighting it as a significant cause of disease burden. Additionally, certain infectious diseases like Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), despite having a lower number of monthly cases (7,897), show a substantial number of all-cause deaths (2,444) in cumulative reported AIDS patients, suggesting the chronic impact of this condition.

## Concerns

Diseases with high incidence such as Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Infectious Diarrhea, though not leading to high mortality, bring to light significant morbidity which can strain healthcare systems and impact public health and economies due to loss of productivity and the cost of healthcare. Hepatitis remains a persistent health challenge, indicated by the combined morbidity across its types. While the immediate lethality is low, the long-term complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma pose serious health risks. Public concern is palpable around diseases with relatively lower incidence but higher mortality rates; Tuberculosis being a prime example with its far-reaching socio-economic consequences. Other diseases such as Hepatitis and AIDS also attract public concern due to their chronic nature and potential for severe health consequences. Despite no reported cases of Human infection with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses this month, the potential for avian influenza outbreaks remains a concern due to prior history and impact.

## Recommendations

Given the reported data and the context of public health concerns, we recommend that the public adhere strictly to personal hygiene practices to curb the transmission of diseases such as Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Infectious Diarrhea, which can be mitigated through such measures. Immunization for Hepatitis A and B should be actively promoted, as effective vaccines exist for these diseases. Additionally, the enhancement of routine screening and treatment accessibility for chronic infectious diseases like Hepatitis C, B and Tuberculosis, paired with public education campaigns, will be essential for early detection and care. The ongoing vigilance in monitoring avian influenza viruses is crucial. For diseases like AIDS, comprehensive strategies should expand beyond treatment to include prevention education, stigma reduction and community support programs.

Finally, an inter-sectoral approach involving health, education, and social services is imperative to effectively implement preventive measures, improve public awareness, and respond effectively to disease outbreaks. Intensifying research into vaccines and cures, especially for diseases without definitive preventative measures, should be a priority, alongside ongoing support for global health initiatives in disease monitoring and control.


# Overview

In November 2023, epidemiological data from mainland China's National Notifiable Disease Reporting System reflects a vast landscape of infectious diseases. The data indicates that some diseases continue to exert a significant health burden, both in terms of case numbers and associated mortality. Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), with 193,230 reported cases, stands out as the disease with the highest incidence, followed closely by infectious diarrhea (excluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever) and Hepatitis B. These illnesses demonstrate a persistent prevalence in China's population, highlighting the need for ongoing public health vigilance.

The mortality data for November 2023 reveals a more nuanced situation. While many diseases report zero or single-digit fatalities, certain conditions such as Tuberculosis (TB), with a reported 96106 cases and 171 deaths, and Hepatitis B, with 106985 cases and 40 deaths, remain causes of significant concern. Though the mortality rates for these diseases appear modest relative to their incident cases, they indicate the severity and impact of these infections on the Chinese population. The data underscores the necessity for effective treatment and management strategies to prevent disease progression and reduce mortality.

# Concerns

Diseases with high incidence such as HFMD and Hepatitis B reflect persistent public health challenges. HFMD, while often mild, poses significant risk to children and has resulted in rare but unfortunate complications leading to fatalities. The public health system must continue to address the vectors and conditions contributing to these high-incidence diseases through both preventative measures and accessible healthcare services.

Public concern, interestingly, may not always align with the diseases of highest incidence or mortality. For instance, while diseases like HFMD and Hepatitis B might register high within epidemiological data, emerging infectious diseases or those with a high-profile global presence—such as the new inclusion of Monkeypox into category B infectious diseases management—could draw significant public attention. Even if the numbers are comparatively lower, the perceived threat or novelty of such diseases can engender substantial concern, prompting the need for public education and preventive measures.

# Recommendations

To address the outlined diseases effectively, public health recommendations should be multifaceted:

1. For HFMD, vaccination programs targeting the causative viruses (Enteroviruses such as EV71 and Coxsackievirus) should be emphasized and coupled with public education campaigns about the importance of hygiene, especially in settings with young children. Efforts to enhance sanitation in schools, nurseries, and public spaces should be a priority, along with guidelines to manage outbreaks.

2. Hepatitis B, due to its high incidence and routes of transmission, warrants a continued and strengthened vaccination effort, especially for newborns and high-risk groups. Similarly, public awareness campaigns on safe practices to prevent transmission and the need for screening and early treatment should be intensified. Ensuring the availability of antiviral treatments can contribute to managing chronic infections and reducing the mortality associated with liver disease and hepatic carcinoma.

3. The recent addition of Monkeypox to category B infectious diseases management mandates a prompt establishment of surveillance systems and protocols for rapid identification, contact tracing, and isolation of cases to prevent outbreaks. Importantly, comprehensive communication strategies to inform the public about the symptoms, modes of transmission, and prevention techniques are necessary to alleviate undue fear or stigma and promote informed protective behaviors.

To summarize, these recommendations require collaboration between health authorities, healthcare providers, educators, and the community. Engagement and investment are vital to strengthen disease surveillance, vaccination programs, public education, and healthcare infrastructure to counter the prevalent and concerning diseases in China's diverse health landscape.

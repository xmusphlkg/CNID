> **CNIDS: Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project**
> CNIDS is a project aimed at monitoring notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland. The project utilizes automated technology and data analysis methods to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities for infectious diseases, enabling timely measures to be taken to address potential public health risks.
> The primary objective of the CNIDS project is to establish an efficient infectious disease Surveillance system that enables real-time surveillance of legally notifiable infectious diseases and internet news. It provides decision-makers with timely information and recommendations to facilitate appropriate measures for disease control and prevention.

# Introduction

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the Chinese mainland demonstrated a diverse epidemiological profile characterized by chronic infectious diseases with high incidence, sporadic outbreaks of acute conditions, and concerns over emergent infections. Data from the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System reflects a considerable burden of viral hepatitis, with Hepatitis B (HBV) reporting the highest number of cases (96336 with 40 deaths), followed by Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) and other forms of hepatitis, signaling ongoing transmission and the need for intensified control measures. The prominence of Hepatitis C (HCV) with 20245 cases and Hepatitis A also delineate the significant impact of viral liver diseases. Notably, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) accounted for a substantial number of all-cause deaths among cumulative reported AIDS patients, reinforcing the imperative for persistent public health interventions in HIV/AIDS management.</p>
<p>The mortality reporting demonstrates both chronicity and acute fatal outcomes from infectious diseases. With AIDS-related deaths peaking (214 deaths), the chronic nature and disease management challenges are underscored. Tuberculosis remains a critical cause of morbidity and mortality, with 83205 cases and a significant death toll (214 deaths), highlighting the persistent public health challenge of tackling TB. While the data emphasizes a relatively lower fatality rate for infectious diseases like dengue fever and measles, the high death count from rabies (46 deaths from 34 cases) and epidemic hemorrhagic fever (17 deaths from 1700 cases) require immediate attention for prevention, control, and treatment strategies.</p>
<h2>Concerns</h2>
<p>The consistently high incidence of communicable diseases such as Hepatitis B and Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is troubling. HBV being endemic in China presents a longstanding public health challenge with implications for chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. HFMD, predominantly affecting children, reports a staggering 153086 cases, necessitating attention towards effective public health strategies and interventions targeting vulnerable populations. The persistent prevalence of sexually transmitted infections, particularly syphilis (83205 cases, 214 deaths) and gonorrhea, calls for enhanced sexual health education and services. </p>
<p>Of public concern is the emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases and zoonoses. Even with the available vaccines, mumps reported a concerning number of 26717 cases. In addition, the recent inclusion of Monkeypox as a Class B infectious disease may heighten public worry despite the absence of reported cases this month, due to the global context of an ongoing outbreak. The sudden spike in infectious diarrhea cases (108329 cases), though excluding other acute enteric diseases, emphasizes the need for continuous sanitary measures and surveillance to protect population health.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>Public health policies should aggressively tackle the high incidence diseases through vaccination campaigns, education, and access to treatment. Vaccination interventions should prioritize hepatitis B and influenza, given the high cases reported (96336 and 130442 respectively). Importantly, comprehensive measures that include the promotion of safe-sex practices and harm-reduction strategies must be instituted to curve the worrying trends of sexually transmitted infections, particularly syphilis and gonorrhea. </p>
<p>The general public should observe strict personal hygiene practices, including hand hygiene, to prevent diseases like HFMD and infectious diarrhea, which exhibit substantial incidence. Additionally, heightened vigilance is required for emerging infectious diseases such as Monkeypox. Even though no cases were reported, the public should be educated about the symptoms, modes of transmission, and prevention strategies for such diseases to curb potential outbreaks. On rabies, the public is advised to avoid contact with stray animals and to seek immediate post-exposure prophylaxis if bitten. Overall, the government should strengthen surveillance systems and improve reporting mechanisms. Coordination between human and veterinary medicine, the One Health approach, is crucial in the timely response to zoonotic diseases. </p>
<p>Finally, as influenza and HFMD show, seasonal variations require public health readiness for prompt response through community engagement, awareness campaigns, and readiness of health services to manage the seasonal rise in cases to prevent complications and halt disease spread.</p>

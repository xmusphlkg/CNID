> **CNIDS: Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project**
> CNIDS is a project aimed at monitoring notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland. The project utilizes automated technology and data analysis methods to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities for infectious diseases, enabling timely measures to be taken to address potential public health risks.
> The primary objective of the CNIDS project is to establish an efficient infectious disease Surveillance system that enables real-time surveillance of legally notifiable infectious diseases and internet news. It provides decision-makers with timely information and recommendations to facilitate appropriate measures for disease control and prevention.

# Introduction

### Overview:<br/>#### Cases Analysis:<br/>In November 2023, the epidemiological landscape on the Chinese mainland was marked by a diverse range of infectious diseases. Among the diseases, Hand foot and mouth disease, hepatitis, and infectious diarrhea (excluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever), showed the highest incidence rates, indicating a pressing need for public health interventions. Particularly alarming was the massive surge in infectious diarrhea cases, which could be indicative of problems related to water sanitation or food safety. Itâ€™s also noteworthy that several diseases retained zero new cases, such as cholera, diphtheria, filariasis, neonatal tetanus, plague, poliomyelitis, rabies, rubella, SARS-CoV, and scarlet fever. This suggests commendable control measures for these infections, although continuous surveillance is vital to prevent reintroduction, especially in the context of significant travel and trade connectivity. <br/>#### Deaths Analysis:<br/>The tally of fatalities highlights the ongoing fight against tuberculosis and hepatitis, which caused a combined total of 371 deaths. The magnitude of these diseases reflects the chronic nature and potential for severe health outcomes, necessitating comprehensive management strategies from diagnosis to treatment. Pertussis exhibited a notably high fatality rate despite not being among the diseases with the highest case counts, suggesting a severe clinical progression or potentially issues with healthcare access or early intervention. Escalating deaths from AIDS (all-cause mortality in cumulative reported patients) are a somber reminder of the societal and individual burden posed by this enduring pandemic. These statistics unveil the uneven impact of various conditions on public health, underscoring the necessity to balance prevention efforts between highly fatal diseases and those with the widest spread.<br/>### Concerns:<br/>#### High Incidence Disease Analysis:<br/>Hand foot and mouth disease, with ongoing transmission reflected in more than 150,000 cases, remains a concern due to its high incidence in young children, who are particularly vulnerable to complications. The disease's rapid spread underscores the need for increased public health education, vaccination (where available), and stringent hygiene practices in settings frequented by children. Meanwhile, the hepatitis category consistently demonstrates high incidences, particularly Hepatitis B and C, underlining the need for bolstered vaccination, blood safety, and harm reduction measures.<br/>#### Public Concern Analysis:<br/>The zero incidence of human infections with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses instills a sense of relief given the potential for these viruses to cause severe disease and spark pandemics. However, the occurrence of a new case of monkeypox, though presently unclassified, raises global health concerns due to its recent addition as a Class B infectious disease. This highlights the need for the public to stay informed and practice caution, especially given the dynamic nature of emerging pathogens.<br/>### Limitations:<br/>The current data presented have notable limitations. The numbers reflect reported cases, which are susceptible to underreporting or misdiagnosis, especially in rural or under-resourced areas. The economic and cultural differences across regions can also influence disease reporting and data accuracy. Additionally, there are often delays in reporting as it takes time for health facilities to diagnose, document, and channel information through the national reporting system, indicating that the real-time situation might differ.<br/>The statistics may also not capture the full spectrum of infections, including asymptomatic or mild cases that do not seek medical attention. The differentiation between clinically-diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed cases further complicates the interpretation as it can lead to inconsistency in case definitions. Moreover, the exclusion of data from the autonomous regions and special administrative regions of China implies that the reported figures may not represent the entire Chinese population.<br/>### Recommendations:<br/>Given the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to address the public health needs on the Chinese mainland:<br/>- Sustaining the fight against high-burden diseases, particularly hepatitis and tuberculosis, through vaccination, early detection, and patient support systems.<br/>- Encourage increased hygiene practices and awareness, particularly in childcare environments, to curb the prevalence of hand, foot, and mouth disease.<br/>- Strengthen health communication strategies to create an informed public that can respond to risks of diseases like monkeypox, with an emphasis on prevention, early detection, and reporting.<br/>- Reinforce disease surveillance and reporting systems to ensure timely, accurate, and complete disease data for informed decision-making.<br/>- Further research is needed to understand the regional disparities in disease prevalence and the underpinning factors influencing public health outcomes.<br/>The broader objective should be the establishment of a resilient and responsive healthcare framework that can balance the demands of endemic disease control alongside emerging infection preparedness and response. The engagement of communities, effective use of technology, and collaboration within international networks are essential components to advance public health initiatives and safeguard against infectious diseases in China.

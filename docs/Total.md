> **CNIDS: Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project**
> CNIDS is a project aimed at monitoring notifiable infectious diseases in mainland China. The project utilizes automated technology and data analysis methods to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities for infectious diseases, enabling timely measures to be taken to address potential public health risks.
> The primary objective of the CNIDS project is to establish an efficient infectious disease Surveillance system that enables real-time surveillance of legally notifiable infectious diseases and internet news. It provides decision-makers with timely information and recommendations to facilitate appropriate measures for disease control and prevention.

# Introduction

<p><strong>Epidemiological Report: Analysis of Prevalence and Impact of Diseases in Mainland China, November 2023</strong><br/><strong>Overview:</strong><br/>The month of November 2023 has shown a continuation of the multifaceted epidemiological profile characteristic of mainland China, with a wide variety of infectious diseases presenting public health challenges. Examining the sheer volume of cases reported within the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System, certain diseases display prominence in relation to incidence. Hand foot and mouth disease, with 193,230 reported cases, infectious diarrhea (excluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever) with 127,630 cases, and influenza with 51,676 cases stand out due to their high transmissibility and wide reach across the population. While these conditions typically exhibit lower mortality, their potential for widespread transmission underscores a heavy burden on public health infrastructure, with implications for healthcare provision and disease containment efforts.<br/>In terms of mortality, the data for November 2023 shows significantly fewer deaths relative to the number of cases, a testament to the efficiency of medical interventions and the nature of the diseases. It's important to note that certain diseases, despite lower incidence, have higher fatality rates, for instance, rabies, which reported 42 cases resulting in 37 deaths. This stark case-fatality ratio reflects the lethality of rabies and the urgent need for post-exposure prophylaxis and preventive measures. This emphasizes the importance of not solely focusing on diseases with high incidence but also on those with high mortality rates, even when they occur less frequently.<br/><strong>Concerns:</strong><br/>High-incidence diseases, while generally less fatal, can serve as barometers for underlying systemic issues such as sanitation, access to healthcare, and public health awareness. Hand foot and mouth disease, being most prevalent, could indicate areas where hygiene practices need to be strengthened, especially in environments frequented by children. Public concern often arises parallel to highly infectious diseases due to their impact on day-to-day activities and the visible toll on communities. Awareness campaigns and public education on transmission prevention become crucial elements of the public health response.<br/>Public concern can also increase with the emergence of new diseases or the re-emergence of past diseases. Even with no reported cases, diseases like Monkeypox which has only recently been included in the management of Class B infectious diseases in September, warrant close monitoring due to their potential for outbreaks and international concerns. Public sentiment often links closely with media coverage, necessitating accurate reporting and dissemination of information to avoid unnecessary panic.<br/><strong>Limitations:</strong><br/>The limitations of the data presented include potential underreporting, which can be attributed to disparities in healthcare access across the vast and diverse regions of China. This can result in underdiagnosis or delays in reporting, skewing the actual incidence and prevalence rates. Moreover, the data focuses on reported cases and may miss subclinical or asymptomatic infections that do not seek medical attention, particularly prevalent in diseases like influenza and other respiratory infections.<br/>Monthly statistics also lack the rigor of annual verification, which might lead to issues with accuracy due to duplication or errors in the initial reporting that are only corrected through subsequent verification processes. The lack of real-time verification adds a temporal limitation to the data, meaning that real trend analysis may be more reliable retrospectively on an annual rather than monthly basis.<br/><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br/>Given the data from November 2023, it is recommended for the public to continue practicing basic hygiene measures such as hand washing, especially for diseases like hand foot and mouth disease, and influenza. For high-fatality diseases like rabies, awareness on the importance of timely post-exposure vaccination is crucial. Additionally, the public should be informed about the need for routine vaccinations and the awareness of symptoms that require immediate medical attention. <br/>For emerging diseases like Monkeypox, while no cases have been reported, the public should be educated on the symptoms, modes of transmission, and preventive measures to contain potential outbreaks. The authorities should ensure surveillance systems are sensitive enough to detect early cases, which is important for disease containment. Meanwhile, enhancing the capabilities for accurate reporting and timely information dissemination can help better understand disease dynamics and guide public health interventions. <br/>The key message for the public is to remain aware but not anxious; informed but not panicked. Leveraging the existing healthcare infrastructure, adhering to recommended public health guidelines, and remaining vigilant in the face of new and re-emerging diseases can significantly mitigate the impact of these diseases on society.</p>

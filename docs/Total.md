> **CNIDS: Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project**
> CNIDS is a project aimed at monitoring notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland. The project utilizes automated technology and data analysis methods to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities for infectious diseases, enabling timely measures to be taken to address potential public health risks.
> The primary objective of the CNIDS project is to establish an efficient infectious disease Surveillance system that enables real-time surveillance of legally notifiable infectious diseases and internet news. It provides decision-makers with timely information and recommendations to facilitate appropriate measures for disease control and prevention.

# Introduction

## Overview

In December 2023, China mainland's epidemiological data reflects a range of disease prevalences and outcomes. Notable attention is drawn towards Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease with 131798 reported cases, although resulting in only one death. This indicates effective management of this highly communicable disease. On the contrary, Tuberculosis, although lower in reported incidence (96106 cases), has resulted in a significant number of deaths (171), suggesting a concerning fatality rate for individuals diagnosed with Tuberculosis. Additionally, Viral Hepatitis, with a combined total of 124433 cases for all types (A, B, C, D, E), maintains a persistent presence, causing 64 deaths. These figures underscore how recurring and common infections continue to burden the health system, requiring ongoing surveillance and intervention.

Analyzing death tolls across various diseases, we observe a sobering impact on the population. The highest mortality is associated with Tuberculosis (171 deaths), which remains a significant threat to public health. Diseases typically associated with lower mortality, such as Hepatitis, still claim lives (64 deaths combined for all hepatic types), indicative of the heavy toll these diseases take on the population, particularly in the context of chronic illness and co-morbidities. Despite interventions, there's a critical need to understand better and address the contributors to mortality amongst those afflicted with these conditions.

## Concerns

High incidence rates, when analyzed, reveal a stark difference in disease profiles. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease tops the chart with a staggering 131798 cases. Its high communicability, particularly amongst children, raises concern, necessitating robust public health messaging and intervention to prevent outbreaks. Viral Hepatitis (B, C) follows with a combined 109298 cases, an indication of the disease's endemic presence, with risk factors such as intravenous drug use and unprotected sexual activities likely playing a role.

Public concern, however, may not align precisely with the incidence or severity of diseases. The zero incidence of Human infection with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses might provide public reassurance regarding the state's avian influenza control measures. However, public unease often surrounds emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases like these due to their catastrophic potential, despite current low statistics.

## Recommendations

In response to the current epidemiological landscape, several public health recommendations are warranted. Continuous public education campaigns emphasizing hygiene practices, such as handwashing and sanitization, should be promoted to prevent diseases with high transmission rates like Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease. Furthermore, it's crucial to sustain vaccination programs against preventable diseases, particularly Tuberculosis, since the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has a protective effect, especially in children.

For Hepatitis, implementing and reinforcing harm reduction approaches, including clean needle programs and safe sex practices, are essential. Particular emphasis on Hepatitis B vaccinations for newborns and high-risk groups should remain a public health priority. Following the comprehensive surveillance data, targeted interventions to address multi-drug-resistant strains of Tuberculosis should be enhanced.

The government and health authorities should commit to ongoing risk communication and community engagement, especially concerning diseases of public concern. Emerging diseases need robust surveillance systems and swift action plans that can be activated to contain potential outbreaks. Preparedness is critical, including the availability of vaccines and antivirals, enhanced diagnostic facilities, and the rapid dissemination of accurate information to the public.

Lastly, while the data does not account for COVID-19, the ongoing global pandemic's lessons should inform all disease prevention strategies. Integrating these strategies within a framework that includes bolstering healthcare infrastructure, promoting research, and international cooperation will be instrumental in ensuring public health and safety.

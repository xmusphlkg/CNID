# Typhus 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Typhus is a group of severe infectious diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria, transmitted to humans through external parasites such as lice, fleas, and ticks. Epidemic or louse-borne typhus, Endemic or murine typhus, and Scrub typhus are the primary typhus group illnesses. Symptoms include high fever, headache, chills, body aches, and rash. Despite its severe complications if untreated, typhus is curable with antibiotics. The best prevention measures are good hygiene practices and vector control.
## Highlights

- There has been a persistent presence of typhus cases throughout the years, with fluctuating incidence but no clear long-term upward or downward trend. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns can be observed, with peaks typically occurring between May and August, suggesting a potential vector or environmental factor with seasonal variation. <br/>
- The overall fatality rate appears to be very low, with only sporadic deaths reported, which indicates either effective treatment strategies or a less virulent strain of the disease in the population. <br/>
- The latest data from November 2023 shows a reduction in cases from the peak in September 2023, aligning with seasonal trends observed in previous years.

From 2010 to 2023, typhus cases in Chinese mainland exhibit seasonality, peaking during summer months (June to August) and declining in winter (December to February). Yearly fluctuations are noted; however, a decrease in cases is observed from 2011 onwards, with occasional spikes. The most significant reduction appears after 2015, with cases often staying below 200 monthly. Seasonal peaks become less pronounced in recent years, suggesting possible improvements in public health interventions or reporting changes.

Typhus deaths in Chinese mainland are rare from 2010 to 2023, with recorded fatalities only in June 2010, May 2011, June 2014, August 2015, and September 2016. Each of these instances reports a single death, indicating a low fatality rate despite fluctuations in case numbers. The overall mortality trend for typhus seems to remain consistently low, suggesting effective clinical management and treatment strategies for diagnosed cases within the healthcare system.
